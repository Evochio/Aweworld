<h1>Admiral Avolc Game</h1>
<hr />
<p>You are Avolc, experienced captain of the east-sea Admiralty, the navy of the Awes.<br />
As a player you will be guiding her actions and influencing her choices, help her become a better captain and leader or perhaps lead her to her doom.</p>

<p>Together you are about to face the challenges of a sea-captain during a crucial time in history where swathes of the world and seas remain unmapped and fledgeling aswell as old nations experience growth, modernization, social challenges and looming conflict. </p>

<p>Your choices will affect the outcome of the story and perhaps even the fate of the nations.</p>

<p>You will be measured in various stats, most of them hidden. <br />
	But there is Morale, Piety, injury, reputation with various characters, time and other secrets being measured from your choices that might lead you down different paths or unexpected ends. </p>
