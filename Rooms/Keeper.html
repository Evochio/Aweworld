<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<div id="story-text">
<p>I arrived at Keepers little office, it was an out of the way place close to the cargo-hold where supervision and record-keeping could be close at hand. </p>

<p>He was surprised to see me enter, one does not always expect the captain to be wandering about and making visits. </p>

<p>“Ah, Captain!” The Wulf rose from his chair. “I was just thinking about you. We are close to our rendezvous, yes? I expect you want some information.”</p>

<p>I nodded firmly.</p>

<p>“Good, good very good. May I offer you some drink? Have some fine teas, no? Very well, straight to the point. We have a lot to go through.”</p>

<p>I sat down at the offered chair. “Im unsure why I could not have been informed of the specifics of this information prior to departure.”</p>

<p>“Oh you know! Insurance for one. I could never be sure if I'd be deemed... disposable if I had no leverage. Secondly, I wanted to make sure you deserved information.” </p>

<p>I had to quirk a brow at that and cross my arms. But before I could say anything Keeper held up a paw.</p>

<p>“Both the Grand admiral and I have not been entierly forthwith with you. On my request acctually. You see, im not so much a citizen of Aweland as I am a member of 'The sailing company'.”</p>

<p>“You are a Spy!?” I tensed in my seat, putting my paw on the saber at my hip. </p>

<p>“No, well maybe yes. I have served that function, but right now I am here with the Grand admirals blessing. But im more of and exchange-agent. One of yours serve as an envoy among us with similar priviledges”</p>

<p>“Explain.” I muttered.</p>

<p>“Hmm, where do I begin” Keeper mused. </p>

<div class="start hidden"><p><strong>Start with why you're here, if not as an officer.</strong></p>
<p>“Oh, make no mistake, im as much an officer in Admirality as im an agent. Its an open deal between our organizations. Sign of trust and such."  </p>

<p>I had to struggle not to frown too much at this. This was rubbing me the wrong way. Keeper continued.</p>

<p>"I have information for the Wulfs from your government as much as they will provide you. However I am not the one carrying this information, I am just here to help you broker it in an equal trade of intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Your Grand Admiral has already supplied me with what your government was willing to part with. Fleet-movements, sightings, trade contracts and rumors from Gryph traders. All pieces to a greater puzzle. “</p>

<p>“The issues rising in the west seas concern both Wulf and Awe alike. I'll tell you this much, there's worse trouble brewing out there then the occasional raid if rumors are to be believed.“</p>

</div>

<div class="what hidden"><p><strong>“What else can you help me with?”</strong></p>
<p>“Well, im to help you make negotiation go smoothly and vouch for the information traded, not do them for you. Its still up to you to deal with Captain Viriltri. It will be fun to see how you handle homeland-Wulfs.” Keeper snickered mischievously. </p>

<p>“Im sure it will go fine though. They will have sent someone thats dealt with you Awes and your peculiar speech before.”</p>

</div>

<div class="what2 hidden"><p><strong>“How much troubles have the Wulfs been having to warrant this cooperation?”</strong></p>
<p>There's always been trouble. But the sailing company has built a network of protection that has kept our shores safe from raids for quite a few decades now. </p>

<p>If you know our history, you've most likely heard that we have a long history with Gator-kind. Your little scare with pirate-slavers a few seasons ago was nothing to the century of abductions and raids our ancestors suffered. We even faced a minor invasion early in hour history that briefly threatened our independence. </p>

<p>Needless to say, we like to keep a close eye on things westward and keep our waters as safe as they can be. But as you might well know, something plagues the sailing routes west of late, worse then ever before. Ships disappear or pass without incident seemingly at random, or at least in no pattern we reccognize. </p>

<p>It grew especially alarming when ships of the company started to suffer the same. Whole units. </p>

</div>

<div class="what3 hidden"><p><strong>“Who could be responsible?”</strong></p>
<p>Well, if we knew we wouldn't be here now would be? </p>

<p>Most suspect the Empire of course. While they are officially at peace with yours and mine kind, their attention most likely on some endless internal strife or western war on that giant continent of theirs. That is merely business as usual for their kind, a form of stability.</p>

<p>Any new irregularity is a cause for concern. Its been a century since they last had a 'Warlord' of some kind. The last one sent their empire suddenly sprawling all over the seas and nearly brought doom to our shores. And that was just a diversion, a minor exploration fleet. It would be the worst fear of everyone if a new one had arisen with eyes eastward. </p>

<p>But Gators are not known for subterfuge. We'd have heard something by now if their 'clans' were uniting. There are other examples that are worthy of scrutiny, like Gryph trading houses sail and trade without incident. Perhaps they're in on it, or perhaps they're as innocent as they claim, their trade-cruisers certainly are not built for war, but we cannot be certain.</p>

</div>

<div class="what4 hidden"><p><strong>Upcomming rendezvous</strong></p>
<p>“So you'll join me in the meeting with our Wulf-contacts?”</p>

<p>“Ah.. yes. Though only as much as i need to as an Admirality officer, I'd rather not my position was known. Wulfs have a... shall we say... complicated internal relationship to "spies" as you say.”</p>

<p>Keeper picked at his claws, trying to appear nonchalant, but he seemed almost nervous. He continued talking quickly. </p>

<p>“I foresee no problems tomorrow! There might be some minor bartering and coy play of words, but most of the deal has been settled beforehand. Viriltri should be well-informed and used to “our” ways.” </p>

<p>“Just speak to him like you normally would, unlike with most Wulfs there's no need to try to impress him or boast.”</p>

<p>“If he likes you, he might offer you a place in his stomach and wont be offended when you turn him down.” Keeper smiled slightly. </p>
