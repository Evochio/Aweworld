<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>I order a search and plot a new course which will take us past the larger and most likely nearby islands that might have caught the wreckage.</p>

<p>I&#39;d send up able male flyers, but i&#39;d be more likely to end up searching and rescuing them instead if i did. The winds are too hard out here, with sudden dangerous up and down drafts which might toss them far out of range of the ship or worse, into the water.</p>

<p>The search is perilous and on several occasions the lookouts up in the mast shout out warnings for course changes to avoid collisions with treacherous reefs. I have map-readers note everything down for future referances, if we&#39;re braving these dangers we might aswell make the best of it.</p>

<p>The wreckage in the water increase, we are close.</p>

<p>A loud thud, creak and long scrape has the whole crew cringing all of a sudden. We&#39;ve brushed against one of the reefs. I immediately order crew to check for major damage but its quickly apparent there are no major leaks.</p>

<p>I clench my jaw. The ship is fast and sturdy. Im glad for the later. But at this moment i wish we were on my old smaller and maneuverable &#39;Barristan&#39;.</p><hr />
