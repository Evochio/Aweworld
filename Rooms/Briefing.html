<h1>The Briefing</h1>
</div>
<div id="story-text">

<p> You are escorted through winding streets by a haggard looking Awe, to an imposing building, The Admirality Headquarters. </p>

<p> Considering how you were rushed from one coast to another in a mere few days and then hurried through the city without getting to rest, you're somewhat perplexed by how long you're kept sitting around in the waiting-room. </p>

<p> But just as you feel yourself starting to nod off, you're summoned into the offices. </p>

<p>An imposing figure stands before you. Age has given this 'Matron-Awe' an enviable wild mane of fluffy fur that refuse containment of the sparse clothing and any effort of grooming. Time has also given her strength, mass and the wide hips of a matron.</p>

<p>Elaborate and decorative epaulets and heavy cloak with golden embroideries signify her rank and status.</p>

<p> "Captain Avolc" Im acknowledged and i take a seat opposite of her desk. </p>

<p>With papers in hand, the grand-admiral paced and studied the final pages of my records, perhaps that had been the delay. I felt as nervous as I felt excited. </p>

<p>“Hmm, Acadamy trained and 10 years at sea. First 3 as junior sailor, bumped up to low-officer for 2 years and then straight up to First-mate for another 3 until you gained your own captaincy. Merely 2 years at captain, but with a rich record to show for it. Commendations from various trade ships you've protected and then Nipfang, mmh?”</p>

<p>The admiral regarded me closely, a paw scratching at her lush mane thoughtfully. </p>

<p>“Yes, the others are naught but freight captains and river pleasure-ride navigators compared to this. I exaggerate, but im glad you're here, the old Crone-Admiral of the East sent me something worthwhile for once. There is no question about it. You arrive late, but you've stepped up to be my prime candidate straight away. ” </p>

<p>“Thank you Admiral!” I snapped curtly. But then felt compelled to add. “... to what, if I may ask?”</p>

<p>This got a rise out of the Grand-Admiral, she laughed heartily. </p>

<p>“You really do not know? They really did send you out here without telling you a thing.”</p>

<p>“Almost straight from ship to carriage, Admiral.” I apologized with a low tone. Truth be told I should have stopped to ask someone and come a bit more prepared. But the Grand-Admiral waved away my concern and approached the map on the wall. </p>

<p>“Well, its excusable, you've been out to sea for months with little news of the on-goings. I'll brief you in quickly.”</p>

<p>I straightened attentively. It was not every day you received a briefing from the Grand-Admiral herself. </p>

<p>“8 months ago, Thunderhill in Gleaming bay was raided.” She rapped at the map on the wall. “The damage was extensive, large parts of the city was set ablaze and so was the loss of life. A literal loss, a lot of Awes went missing, its believed they were kidnapped.”</p>

<p>I clenched my paws tightly. What a terrible event! Thunderhill was raided once before 50 years ago. That was before any routes west were known about and the Spines and Fangs were thought of as untraversable. Since then the West sea saw a considerable mobilization from the Admiralty. Hrystrags was developed and constructed. It was vowed to never happen again. </p>

<p>“They somehow completely bypassed our patrols at both the passage through Sea of fangs, Bay of spines and around Gaping pass. Which means they came either straight through the North sea, something I find highly unlikely, or used routes unknown to us.”</p>

<p>I nodded attentively. </p>

<p>“Naturally, the politicians have been all over the Admiralty over this. I had Voice-Matron Udina here personally demanding my voluntary sacrifice to the fluff.” The Grand-Admiral glowered. I did my best to stay as quiet as possible. </p>

<p>“Luckily, the Speaker and the other Voices did, after review, not quite agree. There are no precautions that could have been done better. The Merchant-league were crawling all over us to better protect their trade routes, as attacks had been growing and ships have increasingly gone missing. Our patrols on the known routes were as thick as they could be. So! Its been concluded that this attack were no mere raid but a focused assalt upon our sovereignty and thus that we are at WAR, Avolc.” The Grand-Admiral slammed her clenched paw on a table with a heavy thud. </p>

<p>I swallowed heavily and managed to utter a question. </p>

<p>“With who?” </p>

<p>The Grand-Admiral visibly calmed herself and straightened. </p>

<p>“We dont know. But that brings us to why you are here.”</p>

</div>
<div class="culprits hidden"><p><strong>Culprits</strong></p>

<p>"There are three nations capable of orchestrating an attack of this magnitude. The Wulfs, The Empire and Kingdom of Plumes. 

<p>The Empire of the gators is in another smaller, albeit costly, civil war. The Gryphs of the Kingdom only care about their trade and the Wulfs, well who truly knows about them, they are afterall not really a nation, more a collection of city-states. But we're pretty sure it wasent the Wulfs, we are in good contact with them and they've reportedly lost trade too.</p>

<p>Yet! Members of all 3 races were seen participating in the attack. The most foreboding thought would be that all 3 nations are conspiring against us, but whats more likely is that this was some form of elaborate and well-financed pirate raid. </p>

<p>All information we've been able to glean or purchase points to piracy originating from the Thousand-islands. And of course, what better place to hide a place of operations. </p>

<p> The boom of the western trade have inevitably given a boom to piracy. Until recently its been mostly benign, merchants having their goods confiscated or being forced to pay for 'protection' if caught. All of this happening outside our jurisdiction, mostly beyond the Fangs and Pale-rock. </p>

<p> But the escalation has happened quickly and could not have been forseen. We were just about to formulate a plan to all the reports of vanishing trade ships when Thunderhill was raided." </p>

</div>

<div class="fleet hidden"> <p><strong>Fleet</strong></p>

<p>“The only natural response to this provocation was to send a War-fleet. We cant hug all our ships close to our ports, that leaves us blind to whats out there and ensures we loose all our trade sponsors. It would be repeating the mistakes of the First-Age. No, the right response is attack.”</p>

<p> The Admiral paced to look out a window at the ship-yards below.</p>

<p> “Its the biggest Admirality operations since "The great blockade". 13 ships all in all, off our latest make and model constructed by Awe paws, REAL warhips this time, nothing like those converted trade frigates you have in the east. With the best crews we could find. Enough to crush any pirate haven and show we mean business!”</p>

<p> I swallowed the urge to defend the quality of my old ship. It was a capable and strong ship that had never let me down. But i had spied some of the hulls under construction when arriving, some looked to become real monsters.</p>


</div>

<div class="role hidden"> <p><strong>My Role?</strong></p>


<p>“Im to join this fleet?” </p>

<p> "Yes, you will captain the 14th ship, replacing a captain after some incident on the ship left them indisposed. The fleet itself however left a month ago. They've sent scattered report by bird, that they've arrived intact and have begun their search and so on. But its unreliable means of communication, some reports that arrive are older then the last ones! But no doubt they're having trouble finding the pirate-haven, its not called Thousand-isles for nothing."

<p>“So..”</p>

<p>“So! You are to sail out there with our fastest ship before the Triple-moon tide closes all known passage west, deliver some intel we might have got our paws on, get a full report and assist if needed and sail right back in time for when the tide opens again. Simple!
I need the best captain i can get, And right now, thats you.”</p>

 </div>
 
 <div class="ship-crew hidden"> <p><strong>Ship and Crew</strong></p>

<p>“Thats right, you'll be captaining a new ship and crew, replacing the captain for the messenger ship that arrived with the latest report.”</p>

<p>“I believe the ship will impress you, its built from our own efforts and materials, a new type of armed escort, nothing like those purchased converted trade-prows you have in the East. Its fast, its hard and it certainly can handle most of what the west can throw at it.”</p>

<p>“While I understand its unorthodox to have a crew and senior officers chosen for you on a brand new ship, I have faith in that you'll learn to handle it and the crew quickly! They will assist you in getting up to speed.”</p>

</div>


<div class="objectives hidden"> <p><strong>Objectives.</strong></p>

<p>“Your mission is 3-fold.” <br /></p>

<p>“Firstly, on your way West, you're to rendezvous with a Wulf-fleet contact at Pale-rock. They have suffered losses of ships and done some digging of their own and agreed to assist our efforts with some valuable knowledge that is supposed to help us find the pirate hideouts. Said Intel is too substantial for messenger bird, hence the meeting. </p>

<p>This “Intel” didnt come cheap. And we have no way to verify how authentic it is. As with any meeting with their organization, its always risky. As such i have assigned a diplomatic expert to your crew. He IS a Wulf himself, one of our few officers, keep him safe. </p>

<p>You have extensive experience with Wulfs, so I have faith in you. Time is short however, so do not delay too long in reaching the rendezvous!</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Secondly, meet with the operational Fleet-Admiral, I want her full report! Return immediately once you have it and once tides permit you passage unless you can provide some kind of meaningful crucial assistance. You may drop off some of your crew as reinforcements, supplies too. Your ship is somewhat over-stocked with crew and supplies both with this in mind. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>And finally, while the main fleet will be hunting the pirate base, if any. Your task is to find a suitable spot to build a permanent port of our own. That means charts, charts, charts. Map everything! </p>

<p>I've we're to prevent future raids or attacks on trade, having a forward Admiralty base of operation will do that and more to spread out influence in the western seas.</p>

</div>

 <div class="wulfs hidden"> <p><strong>Are we working with the Wulfs now?</strong></p>

<p>“We've always worked with the Wulfs, Captain. Even before 'The great blockade' and the treaties we signed with them after that. I know how you might feel, having sailed 10 years in the east to stave off their more.... privateering kind. That they're treachorous and havent changed. But most of them as a whole prefer the old fashioned trade and barter as well as beneficial long-term cooperation. Their concern over the halted trade westward I believe is quite genuine.“</p>

<p>“It doesent mean we should show any sign of weakness however. Your instincts are correct in not to trust them, everyone has their own motives.“</p>

<p>"The Wulf-officer i've assigned to you will help you prepare for the meeting as the day approaches." </p>
</div>

 <div class="tide hidden"> <p><strong>Three-moon Tide</strong></p>

<p>“Yes, Captain Avolc. With the 3 moons together in formation at almost the same spot, the tidal effects are at their worst, especially in the west-sea where furthermore 3 separate currents meet and clash.”</p>

<p>“The low-tides will make the Sea of Fangs impassable and with the currents pulling you away from our shores braving the open sea to get around the Fangs will have you finding yourself starving somewhere deep in the North-Sea, if the giant waves dont get you first.”</p>

<p>“But I dont need to tell you this, the deep open seas are as deadly in the east as the west.” </p>


</div>
 <div class="captain hidden"> <p><strong>What acctually happened with the Captain?</strong></p>

<p>The Grand-Admiral made a dismissive wave of her paw. </p>

<p>“The previous captain did not meld well with the crew for some reason. I only have off-hand reports of what transpired, they did not leave very good logs behind. Something I am hoping you'll change by the way! Write everything down!”</p>

<p>“So what did happen?” I ask, genuinely curious. </p>

<p>“The burden of leadership became too much. They shut themselves away from the crew, got in some kind of spat or another with the crew over orders. Then they disappeared, over-board or into someones gut, i don't know.” </p>

<p>“Needless to say, there is nobody to ask but the officers and I'll have to take their word for it. I could dig into the issue, perhaps at a better time I would have and replaced anyone harboring suspicion in the crew. But I wont. Not only are we short-handed but I have reason to personally trust some of the current officers aboard and if they tell me there are no issues, then there are no issues! They simply were not captain enough to handle the responsibility and maintain respect.”</p>

<p>I could only 'hmmm' thoughtfully, it was not very convincing. It even sounded like a mutiny of some kind had happened. The Grand-Admiral picked up on my doubt and began a speech.</p>

<p>“As you well know, its hard to find strong able leaders that are willing to take the mantle of captaining. The problem with Awes are that we are a willful and free people, unable to always conform and follow the will of another nor in the same way impose our will on another in turn. Few are like you and me, able to see the full picture, take the long-view and make the hard and sometimes unpopular decisions while maintaining the confidence of authority!” </p>

<p>“I... Will make a better job of it, Grand-Admiral.” I straightened my back. Now was not the time to show hesitation.</p>

<p>“Im sure you're Awe enough to handle anything that crops up. You'll do as you see fit as the captain. Just try to maintain everyone's respect for your authority while doing it. If that means knocking a few heads together, petting them or even eating whomever bothers you is up to you!”</p>

</div>
 <div class="ready hidden"> <p><strong>I am Ready!</strong></p>

<p>“I am ready” I announced confidently. I felt the call of the challenge. Only the best were assigned to the west-sea fleet. I was now one of them. </p>


<p>“Very good, captain! I realize this might have been a bit much to take in.” The Grand-Admiral sat down opposite me and studied me closely. A bundle of pages in her paw. “You have a fire in you, I can see that. I will send you out there if you truly feel you're up for it." The Grand-Admiral stared me hard in the eyes, seeming to search my soul. </p>

<p>"But you've been to sea nearly non-stop for 10 years now. You are well within your right to turn this down, have a mid-retirement. Make a family. I understand it that you've had no younglings yet.”</p>


<p>“I... I've been down that path. It was not for me. This is more important.” I don't want to miss this opportunity. Or let other thoughts distract me. </p>


<p>“Very well. You are an career-Awe not unlike myself. Welcome to the West-Seas Captain Avolc!” We both rose and clasped our paws together.</p>
