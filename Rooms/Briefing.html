<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<div id="story-text">

<p> You are escorted through winding streets by a haggard looking Awe, to an imposing building, The Admirality Headquarters. </p>

<p> Considering how you were rushed from one coast to another in a mere few days and then hurried through the city without getting to rest, you're somewhat perplexed by how long you're kept sitting around in the waiting-room. </p>

<p> But just as you feel yourself starting to nod off, you're summoned into the offices. </p>

<p>An imposing figure stands before you. Age has given this 'Matron-Awe' an enviable wild mane of fluffy fur that refuse containment of the sparse clothing and any effort of grooming. Time has also given her strength, mass and the wide hips of a matron.</p>

<p>Elaborate and decorative epaulets and heavy cloak with golden embroideries signify her rank and status.</p>

<p> "Captain Avolc" Im acknowledged and i take a seat opposite of her desk. </p>

<p>With papers in hand, the grand-admiral paced and studied the final pages of my records, perhaps that had been the delay. I felt as nervous as I felt excited. </p>

<p>“Hmm, Acadamy trained and 10 years at sea. First 3 as junior sailor, bumped up to low-officer for 2 years and then straight up to First-mate for another 3 until you gained your own captaincy. Merely 2 years at captain, but with a rich record to show for it. Commendations from various trade ships you've protected and then Nipfang, mmh?”</p>

<p>The admiral regarded me closely, a paw scratching at her lush mane thoughtfully. </p>

<p>“Yes, the others are naught but freight captains and river pleasure-ride navigators compared to this. I exaggerate, but im glad you're here, the old Crone-Admiral of the East sent me something worthwhile for once. There is no question about it. You arrive late, but you've stepped up to be my prime candidate straight away. ” </p>

<p>“Thank you Admiral!” I snapped curtly. But then felt compelled to add. “... to what, if I may ask?”</p>

<p>This got a rise out of the Grand-Admiral, she laughed heartily. </p>

<p>“You really do not know? They really did send you out here without telling you a thing.”</p>

<p>“Almost straight from ship to carriage, Admiral.” I apologized with a low tone. Truth be told I should have stopped to ask someone and come a bit more prepared. But the Grand-Admiral waved away my concern and approached the map on the wall. </p>

<p>“Well, its excusable, you've been out to sea for months with little news of the on-goings. I'll brief you in quickly.”</p>

<p>I straightened attentively. It was not every day you received a briefing from the Grand-Admiral herself. </p>

<p>“8 months ago, Thunderhill was raided.” She rapped at the map on the wall. “The damage was extensive, large parts of the city was set ablaze and so was the loss of life. A literal loss, a lot of Awes went missing, its believed they were kidnapped.”</p>

<p>I clenched my paws tightly. What a terrible event! Thunderhill was raided once before 50 years ago. That was before any routes west were known of. Since then the West sea saw a considerable mobilization from the Admiralty. It was vowed to never happen again. </p>

<p>“They somehow completely bypassed our patrols at both the passage through Sea of fangs, Bay of spines and around Gaping pass. Which means they came either straight through the North sea, something I find highly unlikely, or used routes unknown to us.”</p>

<p>I nodded attentively. </p>

<p>“Naturally, the politicians have been all over the Admiralty over this. I had Voice-Matron Udina here personally demanding my voluntary sacrifice to the fluff.” The Grand-Admiral glowered. I did my best to stay as quiet as possible. </p>

<p>“Luckily, the Speaker and the other Voices did, after review, not quite agree. There are no precautions that could have been done better. The Merchant-league were crawling all over us to better protect their trade routes, as attacks had been growing and ships have increasingly gone missing. So! Its been concluded that we are at WAR, Avolc.” The Grand-Admiral slammed her clenched paw on a table with a heavy thud. </p>

<p>I swallowed heavily and managed to utter a question. </p>

<p>“With who?” </p>

<p>The Grand-Admiral visibly calmed herself and straightened. </p>

<p>“We dont know. But that brings us to why you are here.”</p>

<button class="btn btn-default hidden" id="captain">What acctually happened with the Captain?</button>

<div class="culprits hidden"><p><strong>Culprits</strong></p>

<p>The Empire of the gators is in another smaller, albeit costly, civil war. The Gryphs only care about their trade and the Wulfs, well, we're pretty sure it wasent the Wulfs, they've reportedly lost trade too.</p>

<p>Yet members of all 3 races were seen participating in the attack. The most foreboding thought would be that all 3 nations are conspiring against us, but whats more likely is that this was some form of pirate raid. </p>

<p>All information we've been able to glean or purchase points to origin piracy coming from the Thousand-islands. And of course, what better place to hide a place of operations. </p>

</div>

<div class="fleet hidden"> <p><strong>Fleet</strong></p>

<p>“The only natural response to this provocation was to send a War-fleet. We cant hug all our ships close to our ports, that leaves us blind to whats out there and ensures we loose all our trade sponsors. It would be repeating the mistakes of the First-Age. No, they right response is attack.”</p>

<p>The Admiral paced to look out a window at the ship-yards below.</p>

<p>“13 ships all in all, off our latest make and model with the best crews we could find. Enough to crush any pirate haven and show we mean business!”</p>


</div>

<div class="role hidden"> <p><strong>My Role?</strong></p>


<p>“Im to join this fleet?” </p>

<p>“Yes, except we sent it out 5 months ago and its soon Triple-moon and I've yet to hear a report from them other then that they've arrived intact and begun to search! No doubt they're having trouble finding the pirate-haven.”</p>

<p>“So..”</p>

<p>“So you are to sail out there with our fastest ship before the Three-moon tide closes all known passage west, deliver some intel we might have got our paws on, get a report and assist if needed and sail right back in time for when the tide opens again. Simple!”</p>

 </div>
 
 <div class="ship-crew hidden"> <p><strong>Ship and Crew</strong></p>

<p>“Thats right, you'll be captaining a new ship and crew. In truth, you are an replacement captain for the messenger ship that arrived with the latest report.”</p>

<p>“I believe the ship will impress you, its built from our own efforts and materials and nothing like those purchased converted trade-prows you have in the East. Its fast, its hard and it certainly can handle most of what the west can throw at it.”</p>

<p>“I have faith in that you'll learn to handle it and the crew quickly!”</p>

</div>
 <div class="replace hidden"> <p><strong>Replacement Captain?</strong></p>


<p>The Grand-Admiral made a dismissive wave of her paw. </p>

<p>“The previous captain did not meld well with the crew for some reason. I only have off-hand reports of what transpired, they did not leave very good logs behind. Something I am hoping you'll change by the way! Write everything down!”</p>

<p>“So what did happen?” I ask, genuinely curious. </p>

<p>“The burden of leadership became too much. Shut themselves away from the crew, got in some kind of spat or another with the crew over orders. Needless to say, there is nobody to ask but the officers and i'll have to take their word for it. Leaderless they had to turn the ship around and come back to port.”</p>

<p>I can only 'hmmm' thoughtfully, it was not very convincing. It sounded like a mutiny of some kind had happened. The Grand-Admiral picked up on my doubt and began a speech.</p>

<p>“As you well know, its hard to find strong able leaders that are willing to take the mantle of captaining. The problem with Awes are that we become comfortable in our roles. Few are like you and me, able to see the full picture and make the hard and sometimes unpopular decisions.” </p>

<p>“I... Will make a better job of it, Grand-Admiral.”</p>

</div>

<div class="objectives hidden"> <p><strong>Objectives.</strong></p>

<p>“Your mission is 3-fold.” <br /></p>

<p>“Firstly, on your way West, you're to rendezvous with a Wulf-fleet contact at Pale-rock. They have agreed to assist our efforts with some valuable knowledge. But said Intel is too substantial for messenger bird. </p>

<p>This “Intel” didnt come cheap. And we have no way to verify how valuable it is. As with any meeting with their organization, its always risky. But you have experience with Wulfs though, so I have faith in you. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Secondly, meet with the operational Fleet-Admiral, I want her full report! Return immediately once you have it and tides permit you passage unless you can provide some kind of meaningful crucial assistance. You may drop off some of your crew as reinforcements, supplies. Your ship is somewhat over-stocked with crew and supplies both with this in mind. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>And finally, while the main fleet will be hunting the pirate base, if any. Your task is to find a suitable spot to build a permanent port of our own. That means charts, charts, charts. Map everything! </p>

<p>I've we're to prevent future raids or attacks on trade, having a forward Admiralty base of operation will do that and more to spread out influence in the western seas.</p>

</div>

 <div class="wulf hidden"> <p><strong>Are we working with the Wulfs now?</strong></p>

<p>“We've always worked with the Wulfs, Captain. I know how you might feel, having worked 10 years in the east to stave off their more.... privateering kind. But most of them as a whole prefer the old fashioned trade and barter as well as beneficial cooperation. Their concern over the halted trade westward I believe is quite genuine.“</p>

<p>“It doesent mean we should show any sign of weakness however. Your instincts are correct in not to trust them. “</p>

</div>

 <div class="tide hidden"> <p><strong>Three-moon Tide</strong></p>

<p>“Yes, Captain Avolc. With the 3 moons together in formation at almost the same spot, the tidal effects are at their worst, especially in the west-sea where furthermore 3 separate currents meet and clash.”</p>

<p>“The low-tides will make the Sea of Fangs impassable and with the currents pulling you away from our shores braving the open sea to get around the Fangs will have you finding yourself somewhere deep in the North-Sea, if the giant waves dont get you first.”</p>

<p>“But I dont need to tell you this, the deep open seas are as deadly in the east as the west.” </p>


</div>
 <div class="captain hidden"> <p><strong>What acctually happened with the Captain?</strong></p>

<p>The Grand-Admiral audibly sighs.</p>

<p>“I understand why you ask, but I wish you wouldnt. I was not unintentionally vague before.”</p>

<p>“I could dig into the issue, perhaps at a better time I would have and replaced anyone harboring suspicion in the crew. But I wont. I have reason to trust some of the current officers aboard and if they tell me there are no issues, then there are no issues!”</p>

<p>“Im sure you're Awe enough to handle any issue that crops up. You'll do as you see fit as the captain. Just try to maintain everyone's respect for your authority while doing it. ”</p>
