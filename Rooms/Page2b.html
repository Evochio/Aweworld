Day 2

We have set sail. Role call went mostly fine, except some tittering in the ranks they seemed a behaved bunch. But i got a slight impression it'll take time until they fully take me seriously.

I report the numbers of crew now are 151, a solid number. Before lifting anchor we were joined by 3 young officer cadets right out of the Academy. They will observe and assist, learn about command so they too might receive their own commission someday. I was immediately skeptical to bring such young cabin-fledglings along to the rough Sea of fangs. But their attentive eagerness to serve and fresh loyalty might make them the first allies I have on this ship.  

This is also the first voyage I have been on with an attending chaplain of "The order" along. We conferred briefly before she retired to her cabin and she offered me her services and a blessing of fortune of sorts.

Im doubtful about the new laws of every ship having to have to include a representative of The order. It seems like a waste of space and resources on an already crowded and sparse ship to me. But I suppose its all politics now. There’s no denying the influence of this new faith has grown over the last few years in our society. I can see, having met the chaplain, how they are more often referred to as the “Soft-spoken”, they have a way with words that sets you at ease.

I will keep this journal updated on their usefulness, for ships morale and general order.

I will also make an effort to write down some personnel records. A initial assessment on the cadets will follow.
