<p>I am furious! Its come to my attention that we are yet again down another Raptorian! And to nothing less than those infernal gambling hazard games. The culprit is none other then Keeper once more. I had expressly forbidden this from happening and they dare to defy me.</p>

<p>I had half a mind to march right down there when i got the news. But such a reaction would have looked foolish as it appears its old news. For whatever reason my usually astute cadets have failed to report this little tidbit to me and i had to overhear the news from Packmaster Evok in passing conversation as he complained that he couldnt protect his pack.</p>

<p>The reason no one had raised a general hubbub about it is because First-officer Arn<span class="hidden" id="elda1">, while i was indisposed due to my injury, </span><span class="hidden" id="elda0">has at some point</span> rescinded my orders and allowed the games again. He&#39;s the one ultimately responsible for this.</p>

<p>I need to consider my course of action in this carefully.</p>
</span>

<span class="hidden" id="limmit">
<p> Im very annoyed. Its come to my attention that we are yet again down another Raptorian! Despite my previous orders, none other then Keeper has yet again glutted himself on a Raptorian as a result of gambling. I dont know if that Wulf plans on eating all my Shock-troops. </p>

<p> Whats worse is that i had to hear about this in passing conversation with Packmaster Evok, who expressed concern his raptorians are growing displeased. Not even my astute cadets had deigned to tell me they were once again betting as much as their lives in these foolish games. </p>

<p>The reason no one had raised a general hubbub about it is because First-officer Arn<span class="hidden" id="elda1">, while i was indisposed due to my injury, </span><span class="hidden" id="elda0">has at some point</span> rescinded my orders and allowed the high stakes games again. He&#39;s the one ultimately responsible for this.</p>

<p>I need to consider my course of action in this carefully. Im not comfortable with things happening behind my back.</p>
</span>

<span class="hidden" id="ignore">
<p> Its come to my attention by Packmaster Evok that we are yet again down another Raptorian and a few Awes! Seems the appetite of Keeper, our Wulf Logistic-officer has won the right to consume yet another of the Raptorian ranks. Furthermore, a 3 sailors have met similar fates to other crewmembers. </p>

<p> The gambling is starting to get out of hand and might need to be tempered. Ultimately its my fault for turning a blind eye, but some of the guilt lays with First-officer Arn who's responsibility it is to keep the crew from jumping down eachothers throats. </p>

<p> Evok further went to inform that the games are causing a problem with the Raptorians, as boredom of long voyage and closed-in quarters causes them to seek excitement and thrills wherever they can get it. They are reckless gamblers with little thought of consequence, a strong trait for battle perhaps, but not so much in games of chance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many are now bound down by debts and more of them risk being tempted into &quot;All or nothing&quot; kind of debts that might lead to doom or salvation.</p>

<div class="confront hidden"><p><strong>Confront Arn in private</strong></p>
<p>Arn was not surprised to see me. He welcomed me cordially and with suitable respect and bade me sit down with him over a drink. It was slightly off-putting, considering the somewhat rugged nature I&#39;ve come to associate him with, to see him follow protocol and act gentleawely.</p>

<p>I confess he managed to quite guilefully distract me from the anger i initially felt going into this confrontation. Using formality as his tool, he got me sitting down and tackle this in an official manner. No matter, if this was the game he wanted to play, i was game.</p>

<p>&quot;You are here about the resumed gambling?&quot; he said once we were seated. Straight to the point, more to his character.</p>

<p>&quot;You are damned right i am!&quot; i said with slightly less tact that i immediately regretted. I stretched then and took a deep breath. I would not let temper run this conversation. &quot;My orders have been disobeyed and now i am down another Raptorian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand, its unfortunate. But with respect, I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you that attrition like this is normal. Especially among Raptorians. I&#39;d venture to say we&#39;ve had quite a placid bunch of Raptorians, usually there is more trouble from them amongst eachother...&quot;</p>

<p>I had to interrupt him. It was something about his calm tone. He was trying to explain away the issue, avoiding the disobedience charge. I could eat people for less.</p>

<p>&quot;Which we have to commend the great leadership of Packmaster Evok for. There&#39;s no reason to rile them up!&quot; I leaned forward over the table to gaze into his eyes, gage his resolve in this. &quot;Fact still remains.. i ordered a lid on the games. You have gone behind my back and disobeyed these orders. Why should i not eat you here and now and move to end your little gambling racket before you&#39;ve even started to properly digest?&quot;</p>

<p>Arn picked his words carefully then, i could see the gears turning in his head, afterall, what he said next would determine the closeness of our future relationship.</p>

<p>&quot;It would be in your right, ofcourse, to do this.&quot; He leaned back in his chair, not to avoid my gaze, but to indignantly relax in face of threat. &quot;But as your First-officer i strongly recommend against such action, it might quickly prove to be an unhealthy choice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you mayhaps poisonous Arn?&quot; I chided.</p>

<p>&quot;No, not at all, no doubt im little of an obstacle for the mettle of an Vice-Admirals stomach. I mean the crew would look very poorly on any... aggressive actions&quot; There was a threat veiled in that cordial and calm tone. I sensed a danger then that i hadn&#39;t fully taken into account. Arn continued, perhaps sensing my pause.</p>

<p>&quot;The games have become a familiar pass time for this crew, it was played long before your time on this ship and our late captain turned a blind eye too it. The mix of chance and skill mean anyone can pick up and play it and the risks involved are what make it all the more exciting. Sailors will always gamble, no matter what the high admiralty back in port judges. The game gives them an outlet for that with universally agreed upon rules so there&#39;s no grudges and bickering. Is that not reasonable?&quot;</p>

<p>While Arn talked, it struck me that i didn&#39;t hear about the resumed play of this game until the Cadets reported it. None of the crew had stepped up to report the infraction. It meant most of them were on Arns side in this. Still, i could not back down from this now this far into it.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not agree with these &quot;Risks&quot;. Attrition is normal, yes, but encouraging it with this kind of gambling can only lead to trouble. Especially if it antagonizes the Raptorians!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one has forced the Raptorians to play. They&#39;re not bad gamblers, some have just taken too steep risks and paid for it. Besides, have you even tried the game, you&#39;d see its quite fair if you did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Its not about whether its fair or not, i have to minimize the &#39;risks&#39; to the crew so we have the highest likelihood of success on our journey.&quot; I snapped.</p>

<p>&quot;Its in your right to command the games stopped once and for all, of course. Or charge us to no longer allow high-stakes that lead to loss of crew. But im telling you now, the crew will feel it unfair.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Its your job as first-officer to control the crew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And its what i&#39;ve been doing!&quot; Arn sighed then and crossed his arms and sighed. &quot;I know you cant back down without having your authority undermined captain. I figure theres one way we can settle this which will keep the crew happy, no matter the results. Play me for it in a game. If you win, we&#39;ll back down or do whatever you command. Thats properly high stakes, is it not? The crew would accept and even welcome that.&quot;</p>

<p>Arn was trying to confuse the issue, draw away the blame and make new rules. I had to decide then what to do.</p>

<p>Stay the course, forbid the games again and with a final warning or even eat Arn here and now for allowing this to go on behind my back. Or perhaps find a compromise, take away the risks of it and forbid money and debt to be involved in gambling. Sure they&#39;d mutter about it but get to keep their precious game then.</p>

<p>Or perhaps i&#39;d teach them all a lesson in their own turf. Its suited me to play ignorant of this game and its rules so far.</p>

</div>

<div class="drop hidden"><p><strong>Drop in on a Game</strong></p>
<p>I sent the cadets out to scout me the time and place for when i could catch Arn red-handed. It did not take long.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I burst into one of the commons with the slam of cabin door behind me. I was pleased to see Arn, Keeper and 3 other Awes cringe at the sight of me. To their credit, they kept their composure pretty well and calmly put down their cards and got up for a salute. Keeper sported a sizable sagging gut, I judged he had eaten perhaps 2 days ago. That Wulf had downed two Raptorians of this crew now, one more and he&#39;d stand for 10% of their attrition alone.</p>

<p>But it was not with him i had a bone to pick. It was Arn who had overturned my orders without my permission, it was his eyes on which my gaze fell.</p>

<p>&quot;At ease. You have some explaining to do.&quot; I announced coolly, arms crossed. A part of me wanted to eat everyone in the room and im sure they must have felt that. They shrunk away from me and parted away from Arn ever so subtly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Crew matters are a responsibility of the First-officer.&quot; Arn started, seeming collected and able to meet my gaze, remaining relaxed. &quot;I allowed the games again due to morale issues.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh i see! Morale issues.&quot; I began to pace slowly. &quot;And when were you planning to let me know of these morale issues?&quot;</p>

<p>The others stood and looked quite uncomfortable at this confrontation. Doing this infront of part of the crew was a risk, if this didnt go well, the word would spread quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;I did not see it necessary to report captain, as the issue was minor enough and solved easily and quickly.&quot; He responded.</p>

<p>&quot;By reversing my direct orders! Resulting in further attrition of a valuable resource!&quot; I passed by Keeper and gave his belly a bap with my paw, it wobbled faintly. Arn spoke up more passionately.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand, its unfortunate. But with respect, I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you that attrition like this is normal. Especially among Raptorians. I&#39;d venture to say we&#39;ve had quite a placid bunch of Raptorians, usually there is more trouble from them amongst each other...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which we have to commend the great leadership of Packmaster Evok for.&quot; I interrupted. &quot;There&#39;s no reason to rile them up!&quot; I leaned forward to gaze into his eyes, gage his resolve in this. &quot;Fact still remains.. i ordered a lid on the games. I can interpret these actions as you going behind my back and disobeyed these orders. Why should i not eat you here and now and move to end your little gambling racket before you&#39;ve even started to properly digest?&quot;</p>

<p>Arn picked his words carefully then, i could see the gears turning in his head, afterall, what he said next would determine the closeness of our future relationship.</p>

<p>&quot;It would be in your right, ofcourse, to do this. But as your First-officer i strongly recommend against such action, it might quickly prove to be an unhealthy choice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you mayhaps poisonous Arn?&quot; I chided.</p>

<p>&quot;No, not at all, no doubt im little of an obstacle for the mettle of a Vice-Admirals stomach.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it the &quot;morale issues&quot; again?&quot; I picked up some cards from the table, looking them over.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Captain. The games have become a familiar pass time for this crew, it was played long before your time on this ship and our late captain turned a blind eye too it. The mix of chance and skill mean anyone can pick up and play it and the risks involved are what make it all the more exciting. Sailors will always gamble, no matter what the high admiralty back in port judges. The game gives them an outlet for that with universally agreed upon rules so there&#39;s no grudges and bickering. Is that not reasonable?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not agree with these &quot;Risks&quot;.&quot; I replied. &quot;Attrition is an recorded accepted loss, yes, but encouraging it with this kind of gambling can only lead to trouble. Especially if it antagonizes the Raptorians!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one has forced the Raptorians to play. They&#39;re not bad gamblers, some have just taken too steep risks and paid for it. Besides, have you even tried the game, you&#39;d see its quite fair if you did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Its not about whether its fair or not, i have to minimize the &#39;risks&#39; to the crew so we have the highest likelihood of success on our journey, this is not a pleasure cruise!&quot; I snapped.</p>

<p>&quot;Its in your right to command the games stopped once and for all, of course. Or charge us to no longer allow high-stakes that lead to loss of crew. But im telling you now, the crew will feel it unfair.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I gazed over the others present in the room then. They had stood mute and still through this confrontation. They felt my eyes over them and stiffened. I adressed one of the Awes at the end of the line. A private Oran if i was not mistaken.</p>

<p>&quot;And would you private? Feel it unfair of me to follow through with these orders?&quot;</p>

<p>The private was nervous and took a moment to swallow before speaking, her mouth probably dry.</p>

<p>&quot;Between work shift and sleep shift there often are not a lot to do, captain. There are only so many times gear and floors can be polished without getting worn down from it. The tournaments are fun and some personal bets exciting&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I felt a slight pang of guilt then. These were honest words coming out of the privates mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of personal bets might those be private?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh.. you know...&quot; She blushed. &quot;Personal favors, shift changes, Eat or be eaten...&quot;</p>

<p>Keeper spoke up then to add some input and a bold suggestion.</p>

<p>&quot;High-stakes gambling with permanent results are not so common, most have sense to know when to fold. Look, Captain. Why not play us for it in a game. If you win, we&#39;ll back down or do whatever you command. The crew would welcome and accept any results of that.&quot;</p>

<p>Keeper was a Wulf true to his kins wily ways. Issuing a challenge like that. Things had reached their conclusion. They now waited my decision. Would i stay the course and forbid the games or perhaps i&#39;d teach them all a lesson in their own turf. Its suited me to play ignorant of this game and its rules so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="lessons hidden"><p><strong>Gambling lessons</strong></p>
<p>The Raptorians got themselves in this mess and they&#39;ll have to get themselves out of it. I cant go interfering and micro-managing individual gambling debts, what kind of captain would that make me?</p>

<p>No, since i&#39;ve allowed the games to take place i cant undo it because someone complains. </p>

<p>I can however assign Ziggy to help them improve their play. Or better yet, refrain from getting further in debt!</p>
</div>

<div class="confront2 hidden"><p><strong>Confront Arn in private</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve decided to go see Arn and hear from him what all the fuss was about.</p>

<p>Surely he had things under control, didnt he?</p>

<p>He didnt quite expect to see me, actually being in the middle of a gambling game at my arrival. Which at my annoyance he did not immediately abandon until i started to look peeved.</p>

<p>We moved a way off to talk.</p>

<p>&quot;Officer, whats this about me loosing crew to your games?&quot; I began, sharp in tone.</p>

<p>&quot;They are not my games captain!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well someone has to be in control of it. You cant just let all my Raptorians and sailors get eaten before we even arrive at the Sea of fangs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand captain... There has been some unfortunate upsets lately. I see how why you would be concerned.&quot; Arn made a placating gesture. It annoyed me further.</p>

<p>&quot;As i have the right to be. Why should i not close it down?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The games have become a familiar pass time for this crew, it was played long before your time on this ship and our late captain turned a blind eye too it. The mix of chance and skill mean anyone can pick up and play it and the risks involved are what make it all the more exciting.

<p>&quot;I do not fully agree with these &quot;Risks&quot;. Attrition is normal, yes, but encouraging it with this kind of gambling can only lead to trouble. Especially if it antagonizes the Raptorians!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one has forced the Raptorians to play. They&#39;re not bad gamblers, some have just taken too steep risks and paid for it. Besides, have you even tried the game, you&#39;d see its quite fair if you did.&quot;</p>

Play me for it in a game. If you win, we&#39;ll back down or do whatever you command. Thats properly high stakes, is it not? The crew would accept and even welcome that. Perhaps you&#39;ll even like it and start to join us more!&quot;</p>
</div>

<div class="limmit hidden"><p><strong>Limmit high-stakes</strong></p>
<p>Evoc seemed genuinely concerned about this. I dont know if its because he&#39;s deeply in debt himself or if he really thinks the Raptorians will take matters into their own paws eventually, which is a scary thought.</p>

<p>I cant and wont forbid the games but i can put a lid on the dangerous escalation of debts leading to crew members eating one another unnecessarily much.</p>

<p>I take the issue up with Arn and Keeper and they made a pretty speech.</p>

<p>&quot;The games have become a familiar pass time for this crew, it was played long before your time on this ship and our late captain turned a blind eye too it.

<p>&quot;Play me for it in a game. If you win, we&#39;ll back down or do whatever you command. Thats properly high stakes, is it not? The crew would accept and even welcome that. If anything atleast to try it out before you pass judgment.&quot;</p>
