<h1>Ship Spotted</h1>
<hr />

<p>A ship is spotted by the look-out soon after sunrise north-west of us. A mere speck, it seems be on an opposite course from us, heading straight east, taking it toward Pale-rock. Its quite far north to be heading toward Wulf-lands. And they must know that the three-moon tides should have closed off the Sea of fang passage to Awe-lands by now. </p>

<p>By mid-day the ship has changed course and is heading straight for us. It has wind in its back and will be able to catch us unless we turn around and head away from it. But I have no intention of doing that. </p>

<p>It approached rapidly during the day and its configuration was soon clearly evident. Its too large to be a Wulf-ship and first thought it another Awe-frigate like ours, it sure is of similar design. But the way it carries it sails and the width of the ship is different from anything we have. It could be another merchant-vessel, but its in an odd place. They cant possibly hope to brave the Fangs this close to Tides. </p>

<p>The only prudent thing to do is prepare for confrontation and I order general quarters. All hands to ready stations. </p>
