<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>

<p><em>Admirals log. Avolc</em></p>

<p><em>Safepouch gulf</em></p>

<p><em>Day 10</em></p>

<p><em>I have started to grow concerns about First-mate Arn. </em></p>

<p><em>There is no doubt he is a capable officer, as far as males go. He knows this ship in and out and keeps it in check and good service.&nbsp; He seems to have an amiable relationship with the crew, of that there&#39;s no doubt. But that is also where my concerns lay. </em></p>

<p><em>A first-mates duties are to act as a buffer between crew and captain, his loyalty should always unquestionably lay with the captain first, then the crew. </em></p>

<p><em>But i find myself increasingly relying on the fresh cadets to carry out certain orders or stay in the know. Arn is obedient to a point, his true loyalty in the end lays with the crew and their needs. He speaks for them rather then control them, in a way, like a labor-union leader. </em></p>

<p><em>It is my worry that if i do not maintain morale and a good image, i will find little help from First-mate Arn in keeping the crew in check should there be an incident. Im starting to wonder what really happened to the former captain. </em></p>

<p><em>Strong winds keep us on a steady course. At this rate we will be at our destination in week. </em></p>

<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-1"> Continue </button>

<div class="hidden" id="Glint-dialogue">He takes the quick and easy way to solve a problem. And he does not attend to service of the Order. But he's been generous to grant other leave or changed work shifts to attend... for a favor</div>
<div class="hidden" id="Ziggy-dialogue">Arn is the type of guy you can easily have a lot of drinks with. But if it comes down to a brawl, you'll wont know who he'll swing at. I'd keep him where i can see him
<button class="btn btn-default" id="test">Test</button><script>console.log("whatever");$("#test").on("click", function(){console.log("Horray")})</script>
</div>
<div class="hidden" id="Valnos-dialogue">When the crew has a problem or a complaint they turn to Arn. He is in some ways the unofficial captain of the ship, which i suppose is good for a First-mate. My concern lays in his way of defusing malcontent, he distracts rather then straightens them out.</div>
