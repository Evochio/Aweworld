<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p><em>Admirals log. Avolc</em></p>

<p><em>Safepouch gulf</em></p>

<p><em>Day 10</em></p>

<p><em>I have started to grow concerns about First-mate Arn. </em></p>

<p><em>There is no doubt he is a capable officer, as far as males go. He knows this ship in and out and keeps it in check and good service.&nbsp; He seems to have an amiable relationship with the crew, of that there&#39;s no doubt. But that is also where my concerns lay. </em></p>

<p><em>A first-mates duties are to act as a buffer between crew and captain, his loyalty should always unquestionably lay with the captain first, then the crew. </em></p>

<p><em>But i find myself increasingly relying on the fresh cadets to carry out certain orders or stay in the know. Arn is obedient to a point, his true loyalty in the end lays with the crew and their needs. He speaks for them rather then control them, in a way, like a labor-union leader. </em></p>

<p><em>It is my worry that if i do not maintain morale and a good image, i will find little help from First-mate Arn in keeping the crew in check should there be an incident. Im starting to wonder what really happened to the former captain. </em></p>

<p><em>Strong winds keep us on a steady course. At this rate we will be at our destination in week. </em></p>
