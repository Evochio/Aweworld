<h1>The First-Officer</h1>

<div id="story-text">

<p>Overcast with strong winds keep us on a steady course. At this rate we will be at Sea of fangs in a week.</p>

<p>I have started to grow concerns about First-mate Arn.</p>

<p>There is no doubt he is a capable officer, as far as males go. He knows this ship in and out and keeps it in check and good service. He seems to have an amiable relationship with the crew, of that there&#39;s no doubt. But that is also where my concerns lay.</p>

<p>A first-mates duties are to act as a buffer between crew and captain, his loyalty should always unquestionably lay with the captain first, then the crew.</p>

<p>But i find myself increasingly relying on the fresh cadets to carry out certain orders or stay in the know. Arn is obedient to a point, his true loyalty in the end lays with the crew and their needs. He speaks for them rather then control them, in a way, like a labor-union leader.</p>

<p>It is my worry that if i do not maintain morale and a good image, i will find little help from First-mate Arn in keeping the crew in check should there be an incident. Im starting to wonder what really happened to the former captain. </p>
