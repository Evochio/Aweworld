<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>Most of the morning of the second day was spent in Melons company. Breakfast was brought and served in the cabin to avoid the hustle and bustle of repair work going on outside.</p>

<p>I asked the cadets to along with First-officer Arn oversee and help with the work outside. If they had any opinions about the captain choosing to spend the day with a young child, they wisely kept them to themselves. And Captain Russel seemed grateful to have her out of his fur for once.</p>

<p>I taught her about crew discipline and punishment. The idea that the Admirals rule is law, she can decide anything on a ship, eat those who cause trouble, seemed to greatly appeal to her and furthered her convictions about becoming one.</p>

<p><em>As if on que a report arrived from Cadet glint shortly after. Two thieves have been caught in the act, separately, but almost at the same time. First if of the merchant ships &#39;Steady wing&#39;s crew and the second one from the &#39;Perked ear&#39;. Now as far as i understand from the reports, they both had the bright idea of using the busy bustle of repair work and almost free movement between ships as an opportunity to make off with some of the wares. But were caught in the act by astute officers keeping record of everything moved and a sharp eye out for trouble. Our very own Cadet Valnos was instrumental in catching the Steady wing thief and Captain Russel himself caught our wayward crew mate with a pouchful of coins coming from somewhere she shouldn&#39;t have been.</em></p>

<p><em>Since one thief belongs to the Admiralty and the other stole from my ship, it should be my judgment on what to do with both of these thieving fools. But</em> <em>i have been absent from most of the proceedings on deck so i thought it prudent to allow Captain Russels to pass judgment. </em></p>

<p><em>We&#39;ll be away as soon as the repairs are done. Hopefully there will be no more incidents.</em> <em>Though there seems to be little to sate young Melons enthusiasm. She&#39;s thoroughly fascinated about the idea of joining the admiralty as soon as she is of age. Wearing a too big captains hat, that she&#39;s somehow procured, she insists on one final game.</em></p>
