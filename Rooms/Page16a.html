<h1>To bet or not to bet</h1>
<hr />
<p>I&#39;ve decided to go see Arn and hear from him what all the fuss was about.</p>

<p>Surely he had things under control, didnt he?</p>

<p>He didnt quite expect to see me, actually being in the middle of a gambling game at my arrival. Which at my annoyance he did not immediately abandon until i started to look peeved.</p>

<p>We moved a way off to talk.</p>

<p>&quot;Officer, whats this about me loosing crew to your games?&quot; I began, sharp in tone.</p>

<p>&quot;They are not my games captain!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well someone has to be in control of it. You cant just let all my Raptorians and sailors get eaten before we even arrive at the Sea of fangs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand captain... There has been some unfortunate upsets lately. I see how why you would be concerned.&quot; Arn made a placating gesture. It annoyed me further.</p>

<p>&quot;As i have the right to be. Why should i not close it down?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The games have become a familiar pass time for this crew, it was played long before your time on this ship and our late captain turned a blind eye too it. The mix of chance and skill mean anyone can pick up and play it and the risks involved are what make it all the more exciting. Sailors will always gamble, The Game gives them an outlet for that with universally agreed upon rules so there&#39;s no grudges and bickering. Is that not reasonable?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not fully agree with these &quot;Risks&quot;. Attrition is normal, yes, but encouraging it with this kind of gambling can only lead to trouble. Especially if it antagonizes the Raptorians!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one has forced the Raptorians to play. They&#39;re not bad gamblers, some have just taken too steep risks and paid for it. Besides, have you even tried the game, you&#39;d see its quite fair if you did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Its not about whether its fair or not, i have to minimize the &#39;risks&#39; to the crew so we have the highest likelihood of success on our journey.&quot; I snapped.</p>

<p>&quot;Its in your right to command the games stopped once and for all, of course. Or charge us to no longer allow high-stakes that lead to loss of crew. But im telling you now, the crew will feel it unfair.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Its your job as first-officer to control the crew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And its what i&#39;ve been doing!&quot; Arn sighed then and crossed his arms and sighed. &quot;I figure theres one way we can settle this which will keep the crew happy, no matter the results. Play me for it in a game. If you win, we&#39;ll back down or do whatever you command. Thats properly high stakes, is it not? The crew would accept and even welcome that. Perhaps you&#39;ll even like it and start to join us more!&quot;</p>
