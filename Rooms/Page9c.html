<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>I decided to let the matter go. Raptorians should know better then to engage a Wulf in a game of chance and cunning. Lets hope this has taught them to be more wary, or i&#39;d no doubt hear more of their digestive demise to Wulf stomach.</p>

<p>From what i understood, the particular game of chance they play have been an ongoing thing for a long time before i arrived. Crew matters are the First-officers duty, so I&#39;ll accept his judgment.</p>

<!--Put buttons to other rooms here. This is an HTML comment btw. -->
