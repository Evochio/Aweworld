<p>Admirals log.  Avolc

Year 569

Port Tranquil

Day 1 (69-4-35)

<p>I have been commissioned to captain a Ship and crew.   The “Perked ear” is able vessel of 3rd generation of Aweian Frigates that have seen service and proven itself to be of stable design and has just finished repairs and refit. </p>

<p>The crew, 148 souls (35 Raptorians, 110 Awes, 3 Wulfs) all in all are experienced and already well acquainted with the ship. I will be replacing a captain who was lost in an difficult engagement with blank-flag privateers (Or pirates) in the Bay of spines. </p>

<p>The challenge will be to assert my command early and make my authority absolute. I will luckily have the assistance of first-mate Arn, who I am told commanded the ship ably on its limping return to port, but peculiarly declined an offer of promotion to replace the late captain. </p>

<p>My acquaintance with ship and crew will have to be brief, I have already received instruction to take the ship immediately to the Bay of spines and Sea of fangs. Reports of incursions on our new western shipping lanes are ever more frequent and the fleet needs to show its able to protect its trade-lanes. Not so much for our merchants, though that trade IS important, but also for the ever vigilant eyes of our neighbors, spying for weakness. </p>

<p>Our secondary objective it to regain lost honor from the ships defeat and capture or devour the pirates responsible the Perked ears 'notch' in its record. </p>

<p>I both look forward to and dread the first upcoming role call and crew-inspection lineup later today, it will be my first meeting with the crew. First impressions will be important. Question is what kind of first impression i want to make. I have little to no information about them except that they are an experienced bunch who's had one, albeit brief, voyage together and that they've been without a captain for half that time.</p>
