<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p><em>Admirals log. Avolc</em></p>

<p>I was approached by Sergeant Evoc today about the matter of the gambling going on below deck during the crews off-times. He reported we are now down additionally 2 Raptorians to the games of chance and debt leading them down into their debtors guts.</p>

<p>Evoc further went to inform that the games are causing a problem with the Raptorians, as boredom of long voyage and closed-in quarters causes them to seek excitement and thrills wherever they can get it. They are reckless gamblers with little thought of consequence, a strong trait for battle perhaps, but not so much in games of chance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many are now bound down by debts and more of them risk being tempted into &quot;All or nothing&quot; kind of debts that might lead to doom or salvation.</p>

<p>This is troubling news.</p>
