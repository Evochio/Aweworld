<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p><em>She was most disappointed, the way a little child can be thats used to getting what she wants through charm.</em></p>

<p><em>She reminds me of Glint in some ways. A fact that Glint did not enjoy hearing when she delivered the evening report.</em></p>

<p><em>Said report had some interesting and disappointing news. Two thieves were caught in the act, separately, but almost at the same time. First is&nbsp;of the merchant ships &#39;Steady wing&#39;s crew and the second one from the &#39;Perked ear&#39;. Now as far as i understand from the reports, they both had the bright idea of using the busy bustle of repair work and almost free movement between ships as an opportunity to make off with some of the wares. But were caught in the act by astute officers keeping record of everything moved and a sharp eye out for trouble. Our very own Cadet Valnos was instrumental in catching the Steady wing thief and Captain Russel himself caught our wayward crew mate with a pouchful of coins coming from somewhere she shouldn&#39;t have been.</em></p>

<p><em>Since one thief belongs to the Admiralty and the other stole from my ship, it is up to my judgment on what to do with both of these thieving fools. Though the punishment is pretty clear in Admiralty law, its more of a matter of who&#39;ll get to dispense punishment.</em></p>

<p><em>We&#39;ll be away as soon as the repairs are done. Hopefully there will be no more incidents.</em></p>
