<h1>The Order</h1>
</div>
<div id="story-text">
<p>The services seem reasonably unobtrusive to the ships overall goings on, though things get tight for the gatherings. I do not claim to be a believer in the order, or &#39;Order of the belly&#39; as its sometimes whimsically called. The priestess made no grand entrance and started the service by reading aloud some Old-lore and explaining their meaning. I found my thoughts drifting, mostly thinking about what I&#39;ve learned about the ship during the service.</p>

<p>The Attentive is an interesting ship, very different from my old 2nd generation Schooner &#39;Barristan&#39; which i stubborn stuck with till the end. These "Frigates" are built for endurance and speed, as i first observed, an odd mix considering the extra weight usually needed to make her tough. </p>

<p>But the shipbuilders have employed tricks of engineering that are both admirable and grating. The thick hull in the bow holds metal plates in its center, sandwiched between the wood. This makes us extra heavy in the water and along with the ship being long and thin makes us cut through waves and give us a high speed. The downside however is slower maneuverability and tighter compartments down below with reduced cargo hold for supplies. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> The cowled priestesses voice was soothing to listen to. Even if what most of what she said were platitudes about home and family. The harp and flute play by two crewmembers were also a nice change.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve jotted down one of the hymns from the service. It stuck with me for some reason, despite being slightly ominous now when i think about it.</p>

<p><strong>From the belly we come and to the belly we return. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Of fluff of life we are made and to the fluff we return. </strong></p>

<p><strong>May my eater take my spirit and keep me. </strong></p>

<p><strong>So may we one day all be kept, as one. </strong></p>
