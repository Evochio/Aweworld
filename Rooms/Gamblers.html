<p> Packmaster Evok reports that Logistics-Officer Keeper, has been engaging Raptorians in high-stakes gambling and winning. Winning so much in fact that he won the rights to devour one of them. Raptorians being what they are of course accepted the loss.</p>

<div class="investigate hidden"><p><strong>Investigate</strong></p>

<img id="fatkeeper" src="Images/assets/keepervore2.png" height="10%" width="10%"/> 

<p>I've decided to investigate this issue personally before it becomes a potential big problem. There are too much questionable activity going on. </p>

<p>I found Officer Keeper with Arn, apparently they spend some time together as Keeper has been recruited to maintain track of all bets of participants. I suppose a logistics officer would make an excellent bookkeeper. </p>

<p>Keeper was drowsy from his big meal, unsurprisingly a whole Raptorian had been of little issue to his Wulfish metabolism. But it didn’t stop him from trying to be clever with me. Wulfs can be infuriating in how they walk the line between polite formality and veiled snark. </p>

<p>“A pleasure to see you captain! A social visit, or perhaps you're interested in... joining in?” The smug Wulf smirked. </p>

<p>“You both know why I'm here. Now explain to me why I should not be upset?” I frown at them both. </p>

<p>“Things might have gotten slightly out of hand Captain. This isn't exactly status quo when it comes to bets. Come, look at this.” Arn surprisingly had some documentation to show. </p>

<p>The games are apparently well documented and the stakes signed. Raptorian private Cusp had signed his will before willingly honoring his loss. <br />
I suppose we’ve had an unusually low level of tension and attrition on this voyage so far, especially considering how over-capacity we are, though despite Arns insistence on the issue, I'm hesitant to acknowledge the games as the cause. </p>

<p>“Crew member will find one way or another to jump down each-others throats, whether you permit it or not.” Arn rumbled calmly and coolly. “At least this way we have a manner of control over it. “</p>

<p>The assurance sounded pretty, but the gambling is still at fault here, i have to decide whether to put a stop to this practice or at least put restrictions on it. <br />
I'd hate to micromanage, crew wont like their captain butting in; And what do i know of how deeply the Raptorian desired to be Wulf-meat, signature or not. But the matter rubs me the wrong way.<br />
</p>


</div>

<div class="confront hidden"><p><strong>Forbid the game</strong></p>

<p>Arn gave me some speech about how morale will be affected if I go interfering in what my crew does for a pastime. And it is true these issues are above captains matters. But as I aptly explained to the officers, some games or personal debts should not endanger the crews chances to fulfill the mission. They belong to the Admiralty out here, if to anyone&rsquo;s gut then mine above all. And that&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;d go if he kept misusing Admiralty resources. Atleast Keeper above all should know about use of ships resources.</p>

<p>The point was clearly taken, or so I thought when he made his bashful apology. Arn seemed to only reluctantly nod, one of his big brows twitching in agitation. I had a feeling i was stepping on some toes here.</p>

</div>


<div class="limmit hidden"><p><strong>Limmit the game.</strong></p>

</div>

<div class="ignore hidden"><p><strong>Ignore it for now</strong></p>
<p>I decided to let the matter go. Raptorians should know better then to engage a Wulf in a game of chance and cunning. Lets hope this has taught them to be more wary, or i&#39;d no doubt hear more of their digestive demise to Wulf stomach.</p>

<p>From what i understood, if the particular game of chance they play have been an ongoing thing for a long time, its best not to stir things up. Crew matters are the First-officers duty, so I&#39;ll accept his judgment.</p>
