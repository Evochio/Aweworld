<p>Its come to my attention we are down 1 Raptorian. 
<span class="hidden" id="deepen"> Apperently not to some sea-related disease or accident, but one chose to "deepen" itself with a Wulf! </span>

</p>


<p> Packmaster Evok reports that Logistics officer Keeper, has been engaging Raptorians in high stakes gambling and winning. Winning so much in fact that he won the rights to devour one of them. Raptorians being what they are of course accepted the loss.</p>

<p>Raptorians are an expensive resource and our best fighters for boarding actions. I will not tolerate unnecessary attrition to their numbers. <span class="hidden" id="nodeepen">Also this all sounds suspiciously like that deepening issue from barely a day ago. How can this be any different! </span> I have however been strongly recommended against forbidding the games the crew play on their ofttimes by First-officer Arn, its apparently a long-standing tradition on this ship and keeps them occupied to such a degree that it diverts them from other mischief. </p>

<p><p>The games are apparently well documented and the stakes signed. Raptorian private Cusp had signed his will before willingly honoring his loss. I suppose we&rsquo;ve had an unusually low level of tension and attrition on this voyage so far, though im hesitant to acknowledge the games as the cause. Also this ship isnt even that old.</p>

<p>Still, i feel the gambling is at fault here, i have to decide whether to put a stop to this practice or at least put restrictions on it. <span class="hidden" id="deepen">I'd hate to micromanage, crew wont like their captain butting in, and what do i know how deeply the raptorian desired to be Wulf-meat. But the matter rubs me the wrong way. </span><span class="hidden" id="nodeepen">I'd hate to micromanage, crew wont like their captain butting in, but it feels like denying one thing and allowing another might be disingenuous. </span> </p>

<div class="confront hidden"><p><strong>Confront and forbid the game</strong></p>
<p>I decided to put a stop to it and with Cadet Ziggy in tow, confronted First-Officer Arn and Keeper about it in the holds below, apperently they spend much time together. Keeper was drowsy from his big meal but it didn&rsquo;t stop him from trying to be clever with me. Wulfs can be infuriating in how they walk the line between polite formality and veiled snark.</p>

<p>Arn gave me some speech about how morale will be affected if I go interfering in what my crew does for a pastime. And it is true these issues are above captains matters. But as I aptly explained to the officers, some games or personal debts should not endanger the crews chances to fulfill the mission. They belong to the Admiralty out here, not this Wulfs belly and if anyone&rsquo;s gut then mine above all. And that&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;d go if he kept misusing Admiralty resources. Atleast Keeper above all should know about use of ships resources.</p>

<p>The point was clearly taken, or so I thought when he made his bashful apology. Arn seemed to only reluctantly nod, one of his big brows twitching in agitation. I had a feeling i was stepping on some toes here.</p>

<p>They can have their games, but im stopping the high-stakes part of it.

<div class="ignore hidden"><p><strong>Ignore it for now</strong></p>
<p>I decided to let the matter go. Raptorians should know better then to engage a Wulf in a game of chance and cunning. Lets hope this has taught them to be more wary, or i&#39;d no doubt hear more of their digestive demise to Wulf stomach.</p>

<p>From what i understood, if the particular game of chance they play have been an ongoing thing for a long time, its best not to stir things up. Crew matters are the First-officers duty, so I&#39;ll accept his judgment.</p>
