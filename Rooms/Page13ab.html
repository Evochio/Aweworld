<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>I thought i was dead and had again been&nbsp;reborn. Waking up in the dark and warm pouch of Elda, the ships physician, with little memory of how i got there was&nbsp;quite jarring.</p>

<p>Im told i was hit by a piece of mast that came crashing down during the worst of the storm. A glancing blow to the head and a fractured shoulder with a helping of bruises. Luckily no one else was injured.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been prescribed pouch-rest for at least three days in our capable Physician and Pouch-Matrons care. She is like a stern dotting parent and has refused my request to heal on my own. In this matter she outranks me. Im sure she also relishes the chance to keep an admiral about her person for a while.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arn is acting-captain in the meanwhile, we have a few days of quiet sailing ahead i hope.</p>
