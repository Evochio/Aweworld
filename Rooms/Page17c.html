<span class="hidden" id="forbidArn">
<p>We are the Admiralty, not some salty crew of fray-furred fishermen! And while on an Admiralty ship we follow admiralty rules. They were set for a reason!</p>

<p>I let the cadets call for a quick general assembly on the main deck where i announced the declaration that anyone caught gambling would get a strike on their record. Two strikes and they got to join Arn. If they were caught gambling for money or debts, that was an automatic two strikes.</p>

<p>I told them that while i hoped there&#39;d be no problem following a simple rule i&#39;d have no problem taking care of the ones that couldnt.</p>

<p>A new First-officer had to be chosen, eventually. For now Mid-officer Mirr was temporarily promoted to take over some of the crew decisions and duties Arn had, pending full promotion if she proved up for the task. She has been managing shifts and other crew arrangments without a single complaint from anyone so far. And despite being somewhat petite her crisp clear voice when relaying commands had a ring of authority to it.</p>

<p>For what its worth, Arn was a tough piece of seafluff to digest, kept me up most of the following night. But in the end his disobedience ended with a wet belch.</p>

<p>We are the Admiralty, not some salty crew of fray-furred fishermen! And while on an Admiralty ship we follow admiralty rules. They were set for a reason!</p>

<p>My mind was set, the crew may crumble but no amount of protests would sway my oppinion about this. I let the responsible know that they were being let off easy for this. I let the cadets call for a quick general assembly on the main deck where i announced the declaration that anyone caught gambling would get a strike on their record. If they were caught gambling for money or debts, that was an automatic two strikes.</p>

<p>I told them that while i hoped there&#39;d be no problem following a simple rule i&#39;d have no problem taking care of the ones that couldnt.</p>

<p>I was tempted to choose a new First-officer because of this whole event. But we could not afford the potential turbulence of such a decision while out at sea.</p>

<p>For what its worth, Arn bowed his head to my orders and obeyed, offering no further resistance. But the cleft between us had grown even further.</p>
