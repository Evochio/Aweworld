<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>We are the Admiralty, not some salty crew of fray-furred fishermen! And while on an Admiralty ship we follow admiralty rules. They were set for a reason!</p>

<p>I let the cadets call for a quick general assembly on the main deck where i announced the declaration that anyone caught gambling would get a strike on their record. Two strikes and they got to join Arn. If they were caught gambling for money or debts, that was an automatic two strikes.</p>

<p>I told them that while i hoped there&#39;d be no problem following a simple rule i&#39;d have no problem taking care of the ones that couldnt.</p>

<p>A new First-officer had to be chosen. Second-officer and Helmsman Mirr was temporarily promoted, pending full promotion if she proves up for the task. She has been stable on the rudder and has a crisp clear voice when relaying commands.</p>

<p>For what its worth, Arn was a tough piece of seafluff to digest, kept me up most of the following night. But in the end his disobedience ended with a wet belch.</p>
