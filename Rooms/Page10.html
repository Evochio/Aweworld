<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>

<p><em>Admirals log. Avolc</em></p>

<p><em>The merchant ship</em></p>

<p><em>Day 14</em></p>

<p>Lookout reports ship on the horizon headed towards us at first light this morning. We are still a distance away from the Sea of fangs, but i had the ship and crew readied nevertheless for trouble.</p>

<p>As we got closer, it became evident that the approaching Merchant-ship was barely limping along in the water, showing signs of great damage from battle. Banners flew with the crest of the Awe and the merchant league.</p>

<p>The ship was lilting slightly, one of its sails were in tatters and the aft portion of the ships looked scorched from fire. It seemed a miracle that it was still afloat, a bad storm would have been enough to topple this ship to its doom.</p>

<p>I ordered us up alongside the ship, the &quot;Steady wing&quot; as its named, so we might connect, it seemed unlikely this was any pirate-ruse and was quickly greeted by a very grateful captain. His name was Russel, a male awe that looked like he&#39;d seen plenty of sea. Clinging to his side was also a little young awe, his daughter Melon.</p>

<p>They report being attacked by pirates, information they have would be important. But our mission was also pressing. I had to decide on appropriate course of action.</p>
