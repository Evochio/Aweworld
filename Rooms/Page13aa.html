<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>The crew of &quot;The perked ear&quot; are to be commended, for whatever faults no one can question their skill when it the matters.</p>

<p>We lost a piece of the top second mast however and it came tumbling down onto deck. There are casualties, one overboard, fell from the masts and presumably lost at sea and two hit by falling pieces. The last two are in tending pouch-care of ships physician Elda. Im told they will recover. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The wind is finally dying down however and we are out of the worst of it.</p>
