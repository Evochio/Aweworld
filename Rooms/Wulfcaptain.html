at the western point of Pale-rock. Impressive jagged cliffs decorated the end of the windswept cold island. Southeast from here lay the Wulf lands. It is strange to consider how close our nations lay to each other. But besides the somewhat calm east-sea the routes are long and ever fraught with perils.</p>
<p>It does not take long for our spotter to detect the sails of another ship heading for us. A Wulf interceptor by the look of it. Wulfs have always preferred small nimble ships, the interceptor was the quickest of their kind. It might even rival the perked ear while going straight. But its strengths lay in its agility and quick turns. </p>
<p>One interceptor was no threat however, it is merely half our size and has a smaller crew. But the problem with Wulfs were that they often came in groups.
This interceptor appeared to be alone and as it closed in, its flags were confirmed as part of the &ldquo;The sailing company&rdquo;, which would be the Wulf organized navy of privateers. Our contacts. </p>

<p>As they came in along-side to dock with our ship, I ordered most personnel on deck, with weapons at the ready not far from reach. My experiences with Wulfs on the east sea has taught me to never fully make assumptions of their intentions. The Raptorians I kept under deck for now, as a potential surprise. <br />
The docking was uneventful. The differences in crew was as always interesting. Where our brave Awes stood in fine rows, the wulfs seemed content with having no organization what so ever, standing in spaced bunches in every feasible nook of their ship and an alarming number of them gawking down from the sails and ropes. <br />
As soon as a plank was lowered, a short figure marched over. Wearing a captains overcoat a young looking Wulf lass peered around with suspicion before fixing me with a sneer.<br />
<span class="late hidden">"You late!" She spat angrily.</span>
<span class="time hidden">&ldquo;You captain?&rdquo; She asked with a youthful voice.</span>

<span class="hidden" id="keeper">I glanced over at Keeper, who was looking somewhat chagrined, this sure wasent Captain Viriltri. Things just got complicated.</span>

<div class="formal hidden">
<p>I cleared my throat briefly, it was best to do this by the book.</p>

<p>“Hail. I am indeed Avolc, captain of this vessel, well-met under the flag of truce! I was told we were to meet an esteemed captain, a male Wulf by the name of Viriltri. “</p>

<p>My words were met with silence. The young wulf ahead of me grimaced, like she had tasted something foul and then cocked her head at me and spat her words.</p>

<p>“Wuh!? Straight-speak Captain vessel-whatevers! This Captain be Viska now. We meet now!”</p>

<p>I had to pause at that. I would have expected some crudeness from a native Wulf, but this one was just plain insolent, responding to my politeness with her Wulf-speak too. I could almost sense some of my officers tensing in the line behind me. </p>

<p>“I... see. Im led to believe we had an understanding. An exchange of information...” I trailed off as Viska was shaking her head vigorously. </p>

<p>“Old deal! No exchange for Viska!” </p>

<p> An awkward silence followed where we stared eachother down. I was waiting for her to continue, to elaborate, while she just stared. The tension grew like an itch in the air, in the end i scratched. </p>

<p>"Shall we discuss this further in private?" I forced a smile. </p>

<p> Viska just scoffed at me, turned on her heels and strode back over the plank connecting our ships. </p>

<p> "Come!" Was all she muttered with her back turned. I was already feeling a headache growing, we were off to a less then stelar start </p>


</div>

<div class="short hidden">

<p>I frowned back at her.</p>

<p>“Where is your captain? I was told our contacts name was Viriltri.” I responded with brusque annoyance. There was no need to pretend formality.</p>

<p>The young wulf merely shrugged and didnt even bother to look at me as she responded, her gaze traveling about my ship and crew. </p>

<p>“I ate him a while back... fair and square. Viska captain now.” </p>

<p>She had a thick dialect in her Awe-speech, I was surprised to hear her speak it however while her posture and was the epitome of non-nonchalance, she looked almost bored. Some of the Wulfs perching in the ropes above sniggered and snickered. It was difficult to imagine someone so young in charge of anything, no less a crew of anarchical wulfs.</p>

<p>“Then our deals are with you, Viska. You have information for us.” </p>

<p>Viska seemed to weigh my words, looking like she was sucking on one of her fangs in a thoughtful manner. In the end she showed her paws in an odd gesture and turned back towards her ship.</p>

<p>“Captains will speak.” She beckoned and strode back over the plank. It seemed I was invited to a meeting.</p>

</div>

<div class="shortkeeper hidden">

<p>I frowned back at her.</p>

<p>“Where is your captain? I was told our contacts name was Viriltri.” I responded with brusque annoyance. There was no need to pretend formality.</p>

<p>Viska seemed to weigh my words, looking like she was sucking on one of her fangs in a thoughtful manner. In the end she showed her paws in an odd gesture and turned back towards her ship.</p>

<p>“Captains will speak.” She beckoned and strode back over the plank. It seemed I was invited to a meeting.</p>

</div>

<div class="wulf hidden">
<p>Perhaps it was best to talk to a wulf like a wulf after all. </p>

<p>“This me, who mewls in my face?”</p>

<p>I grinned confidently, I think I got the dialect right as the young Wulf perked noticeably and fixed her previously distracted gaze to my face. </p>

<p>“Viska speaks, not mewls! This be Captain to captain.”</p>

<p>She claimed herself captain and not to look down at her age. Which might mean our contact, Captain Viriltri is no more or has stepped down. I could only think of a few places the Wulf would have stepped down too. </p>

<p>“The one we seek... with deals awaiting, is met in Viska then.” I was not very good at Wulf-speak. Something I said seemed to bemuse her. </p>

<p>“Aye, seek the deal in Viska. New deal...” She opened her mouth and pointed inward with a smirk. “..Old deal.”</p>

<p>She was being obtuse even for Wulf-speak, using my weakness in the language. It was clear she was using play of words to get me to agree to something I might seriously regret. A dodge was necessary. </p>

<p>“Old or new, let speak deal captain to captain.” I gestured toward her ship and smiled. </p>

<p>“Aye! Lets be met.” Viska nodded almost eagerly and turned on her heel and marched back toward her ship. I followed, alone. Much to my officers chagrin. </p>

</div>

<div class="keepers hidden">

<p> Keeper suddenly cleared this throat and stepped forward. He was carrying a binder of documents. </p>

<p> "Before you retire to speak. I believe this gift of exchange of information had been promised" </p>

<p> Viska spun around, tail whirling, she stared at Keeper balefully and suspiciously. It seemed to have a unexpected effect on the spectacled Wulf, he shrunk under the gaze and took a hesitant step backwards and nearly dropping the binder. </p>

<p> "Mewler! Speak-dare! Awe-speak!" She almost spat, angered. "Viska take gift! But old-deal still no-deal!" She marched up to Keeper who made an visible effort to stay put and yanked the binder from him and then marched back toward her ship.</p>

</div>

<div class="cabin hidden">
<p>The captains cabin of the Wulf-ship was sparse and barely even larger then a low-ranking officers hut. But it had the privacy and room for two captains to converse in peace. </p>

<p>As I entered Viska unbuttoned her overcoat casually and sat down in a rather luxurious if compact looking lounge-chair, it was in-fact probably what passed for a bed in here as I did not spot any beds. I took a seat in a plainer chair opposite her. </p>

<p>“So...” I began as Viska interrupted in thick and slow accent. </p>

<p><span class="evokBelly hidden">"Awe-captain has big fluff-tum, Viska approve-reccognize Awe strength." The wulf spoke seemingly approvingly and pointed at my sizable gut.</span> </p> 

<p><span class="evokBelly hidden">"Ah... yes. I had to eat my Raptorian packmaster a day or so back." I mutter. Not entierly proud over that, but pleased that it had some possitive effect on the young wulf. "So... our deal?"</span></p>

<p>“I wish to eat Awe. In new deal. I want you to become me, but will not challenge-fight. Maybe other fluffy one, if offer-good, or no information.” She looked at me expectantly, almost eagerly. </p>

<p>“You cant just remake a deal with such claims!” I growled angrily. She had some nerve to demand me or someone of my choosing sacrifice themselves to her appetite. </p>

<p>“Viska can! Viska did!” She hissed back, matching my temper. “You leave, or you come here...” She caressed at her exposed belly firmly. “... or no deals and papers for Awe!” She waved her paw at her desk where a small chest with a lock lay. So there was the Intel. </p>

<p>I figured i had a shot or two at figuring out a method of changing her mind before anything drastic had to happen. </p>
</div>

<div class="keepersdoc hidden">

<p> "Old deal or not, you've just taken a gift of some value from us. Surely thats worth something, if not for you, then for your organization. </p>

<p> Viska looked annoyed. Wether she liked it or not, she had in a way accepted part of the old deal when taking the documents. Still she protested. </p>

<p> "Old-deal is no-deal! No value for Viska! But Viska thank for gift." She looked unhappy</p>

</div>

<div class="threaten hidden">
<p>“Why would I let you digest me or one of my crew just for some words in a paper!” I sneered. </p>

<p>“Because, Awe-captain. Papers say warnings for Awe fleets. Many Awe ships pass here, right toward maws of foes. Mhmm, many a Awe will digest if Viska not get one.” she made a sound like a 'chrrbl'. No doubt she was pleased with her bargaining position. </p>

<p>“This is blackmail! Perhaps i'll take them from you!” I stole a glance towards the chest. I was larger and armed. I could easily take on this young brash impudent Wulf.</p>

<p>Viska merely cackled, she seemed to tense in her chair, a paw inside her coat, perhaps on a weapon. </p>

<p>“Then we be fighting. All be fighting! And even if brave Awe win over Wulf, they not find papers.” </p>

<p>I grimaced, ofcourse the papers werent in the chest. Just like a Wulf to be sneaky like that. It would seriously jeopardize the mission if I couldnt find that intel. Our fleet could be lost because I lost patiance. </p>

<p>“You head-thinking? Being me is better then fight.” Viska teased gleefully while she rubbed at her belly. She reminded me of the worst sides of Ziggy. I vowed to never let those two meet. </p>
</div>

<div class="bargain hidden">
<p>“Surely you see that without knowing the contents of this intel I can not commit to any... extreme deals.” I reigned in my temper, perhaps she could see reason.</p>

<p>“That Awe-captain problem. Viska-deal is deal-deal.” She stubbornly persisted, crossing her arms. Her speech became increasingly thick when she was upset. </p>

<p>“Do you think Sailing-company would feel the same? About you changing previous arrangements. Perhaps our side will retract what we've offered.” I had no way of knowing what was being exchanged from our side in this, I had to assume it was good.</p>

<p>Viska fidgeted visibly at this. Some of it must rub her the wrong way. </p>

<p>“Surely some form of compromise can be reached.” I ventured, not sure how much you could compromise her terms. </p>

<p> Viska kept squirming in her seat, arms crossed stubbornly. </p>
</div>
<div class="plead hidden">
<p>“Viska, please. You've claimed to have read the reports, so you know it must be important to us. To the safety of our coast!”</p>

<p>She seemed to frown at my words, so I went on. </p>

<p>“Your kind saw devastating raids from slavers barely a century ago. We might suffer the same if we cant have these documents! Dont be stubborn!” I pleaded to her conscience, surely she'd see what her stubbornness was risking. But I assumed wrong. </p>

<p>“Awe-captain say please-please, like pup without snack-eats. But is not Viska-deal that will raid. Is Awe-captain that is stubborn. Be Viska! Awe-home then safe, maybe.”</p>
</div>
<div class="rope hidden">
<p>“Where are your companion-ships Viska? I know enough of your tactics that small interceptors like this travel alone. You like to back each-other up. “</p>

<p>Viska looked at my face and frowned. Annoyed perhaps at my change of subjects. She shrugged in the end, as if revealing this much wasent so bad.</p>

<p>“Awe-ship slow, late. <i>Swift-sibling </i>went find Awe. No find, no see?” Viska seemed interested in our answer. If indeed the Wulf ship had gone to wait for us by Sea of fangs its unlikely it would have missed us, the path through is only so wide. </p>

<p>“We found something in the fangs. It had been... attacked” I dug up the burned rope piece and put it down on the table. Viska was immediately up on her feet to inspect it, turning it in her paw. </p>

<p>“Twistle-rope.” She sniffed it. “Burned recently!” She looked up at my alarmed and angry. “Know-tell! What-see!” Her speech became thickly Wulfish. </p>

<p>“We found a smoldering wreck, off-route deep in the sea of fangs, nothing or no-one on board.” I answered calmly. </p>

<p> "Off-route!? Brave! What Wulf-ship do there?" Viska began to pace, deep in thought, but it only lasted moments before she looked resigned, planting herself back on her chair.</p>

<p>“No good... should not come. Deal-stupid!” She muttered to herself, nibbling at her claws, most of it unintelligible.</p>

<p>“Whats been happening out here in the west-sea anyway?” I probed gently, but she would not take the bait. </p>

<p>“All in papers. Awe-captain agree to terms! Well!?” She hissed, recovering to her own nasty self. </p>

</div>
<div class="question hidden">
<p>“Whats the real reason for this change of agreed deals?” I pried, leaning back in my own seat. “Or your sudden change of captains?”</p>

<p>Viska kept her arms crossed and put on a mute face. Choosing to stay adamant about her position or not let questions sway her. I kept prodding. </p>

<p>“What about your companion-ships? Or what do you call em, hunting partners? Why are you out here on your lonesome?” </p>

<p>My prying finally got her to irritatedly hiss at me and swat the air with her paw. </p>

<p>“Needle-ask no-more! Viska no tell Awe nothing without deal!”</p>

<p>“Oh.. so the answers to some of these have to do whats in those papers, eh?” I smirked, starting to glean some truths. Something has caused a lot of strife out here thats made even the Wulfs nervous. </p>

<p>“Yes! But you will know when you me! Leave rest to other crew!” She stubbornly and persistently patted her belly again. </p>

</div>



<div class="propose hidden">
<div class="hidden" id="nipfang">
 <p> We eyed each other a long while. It struck me that this kind of brash young Wulf might be fought with equal attitude. Fire with fire so to speak. I smirked at her and adjusted my belt around my waist, the weight of previous meals haunting my figure. </p>
<p> "You talk so boldly of me being the meal in this scenario. But why don't you simply hand me the documents and I'll honor you with my stomach afterwards"  </p>

<p> She looked almost briefly dumbfounded before she emitted a bemused laugh. She seemed to strain to make an effort with her Awe-tongue, taking on the challenge. </p> 

<p> "Beheh! Awe-talk bold. But empty, like belly! Why me give strength to Awe-captain when Viska stronger, strength of Wulf-captain and first-mate behind eyes!" </p>

<p> Some Wulfish idioms were peculiar, but i got the gist of it. Wulfs thought their souls were in or behind their eyes. </p>

<p> "I too carry the strength of Wulf-captain behind my eyes. Viska would not be alone." </p>

<p> "Ha, what Captain of tiny fishy-ship Awe-captain catch-eat?" She scoffed, crossing her arms in a disbelieving way. </p>

<p> "Well, I think his name was Nipfang. He was no harmless fisherman." I drummed my paws on my belly, thinking back to that close duel and its satisfactory conclusion. </p>

<p> She jolted upright in her seat at the mention of that name. Quickly sputtering words heavy in her dialect in my direction. </p>

<p> "Nipfang! Talk-false! Nipfang-tale hear-speak even in west. Raid, eat, win, No sailing-company, only own strength! Never loose!" </p>

<p> "Well he's all here." I smirked and jiggled my belt. What luck, it seems Nipfang was popular with this young Wulf. I could not resist rubbing it in, whether she believed me or not. "Nipfang is my strength now. You can admire me instead, or join me." I chuckled. </p>

<p> Viska seemed to fume at this. I had no way to prove the deed so she might not believe me, or maybe she didn't want to believe me. In any case, i seem to have taken the edge out of her confidence. </p>

<p> Viska looked unimpressed, shaking her head, she seemed almost to have a condescending look of pity for me as she straightened slightly to lecture me. </p>

<p> "Awe-captain not understand! Viska-strength bigger then Awe-captain, why strong make weak little stronger, when weak can make strong stronger!" She aided her explanation with paw jestures to make it easier for me. </p>

<p> I sighed as it seemed this way a pointless endeavor and was getting me no closer to getting the documents. Viska diligently continued, looking like she was starting to loose patience with our talks. </p>

<div class="notConvinced hidden"><strong>Viska is not convinced</strong>
<p>“Mwah!” The young wulf suddenly exclaimed. “No more talk, Awe-captain talk talk ask! Viska listen no more. Viska make decision!” The way she kept refering to herself in third-person in that accent was starting to grate on me.</p>

<p>“Viska tired by talks! Viska-deal or no deal! Be food or go away!” She cocked her head, her eyes gazing intently into mine. “You be food?”</p>

<p>My words had not swayed her, which left few options remaining. We can continue our mission without the documents, but it will not reflect well on my mission reports in our eventual return. </p>

<p> I wish i could teach this upstart youth a lesson, but it might have dire consequences. </p>
</div>


<div class="compromise hidden"><strong>Viska is willing to compromise</strong>

<p>“Mwah!” The young wulf suddenly exclaimed. “No more talk, Awe-captain talk talk ask! Viska listen no more. Viska make decision!” The way she kept refering to herself in third-person in that accent was starting to grate on me.</p>

<p>“Awe-captain make sense. Awe really need paper and Viska will give...” Before I could relax, she continued quickly. “IF, Viska gets to eat another Awe!”</p>

<p>My scowl must have been a serious thing for she added once more. “OR, Viska get to eat Awe-captain, be strongest captain, then let go.”</p>

<p>“You're saying I either sacrifice one of my crew to you or submit to catch and release?” I sighed. </p>

<p>“Yes-yes. Awe-captain not hear?” She waved her paw irritably. </p>

<p> My fur must have bristled in irritation, for Viska eyed me suspiciously and put her paw on a rope, probably something attached to a bell or alarm. </p>

<p> "No fight! Or Intel gone! Take deal or go!" </p>

<p> She had more spunk and audacity then any Wulf i met. How much were i willing to play into her paws (Or gut in this case) and could i really trust her to hold her word? </p> 

<p> Even if she did, there was no doubt submitting to her would mean her flaunting her childish dominance for all to see. But could i really afford the risk of passing up this potential information? </p>
</div>

<div class="convinced hidden"><strong>Viska is convinced</strong>
<p>“Mwah!” The young wulf suddenly exclaimed. “No more talk, Awe-captain talk talk ask! Viska listen no more. Viska make decision!” The way she kept refering to herself in third-person in that accent was starting to grate on me.</p>

<p>“Awe really need paper. Awe-captain pass test! Take paper and go. Viska not hungry anymore.”</p>

<p>It was altogether a surprising turn of events. Pressuring her the right way seemed to do the trick. </p>

<p>“Oh? Thats splendid! Im glad you could come to terms.” I said carefully. </p>

<p>“Well! Viska still want to eat you.” The young captain said conversationally, getting up from her seat casually and turning it upside down. Attached a hidden compartment under it, she produced a folder of bound papers. The seal on it was broken, but I chose not to make comment. </p>

<p>“If... Awe-captain lets Viska swallow her...” She continued, she sure was endlessly persistent. “Viska will let Awe-captain go after! And be happy with Awe. Maybe... do favor, yes?” </p>

<p> She had more spunk and audacity then any Wulf i met. Could i really trust her to hold her word? </p> 

<p> Even if she did, there was no doubt submitting to her would mean her flaunting her childish dominance for all to see. </p>

<p> I wondered briefly what kind of favor she could possibly offer for such a deal. And if the humuliation would be worth it. </p>

</div>

<div class="attackViska hidden"><Strong>Attack Viska</strong>
<p>There was only so much ridiculous demands and Wulf hi-jinks I could tolerate. I tried counting upward to remain my cool, but only found myself thinking of ways to attack the Wulf captain. </p>

<p>Truce be damned, I had to try to get that intel by any means necessary and teach this Wulf a clear lesson in pissing off Awes!</p>

</div>

<div class="pin hidden "><Strong>Pin the wulf</strong>
<p>I throw myself at the young Wulf suddenly, reaching out to clasp her and get her under my superior weight. </p>

<p>There are not many places for her to escape inside the tight quarters, Viska coils herself up under my charge and as I grab her, she slips like a eel out of my grip before I can pin my weight on her. </p>

<p>I should have expected her to be fast and dexterous. So my surprise she does not try to use her opportunity to flee the room, but clings herself close to me, wriggling around to my back clasp me around my wings and pull at my arms. </p>

<p>I grunt and struggle with her, rolling and trying to knock her against a hard surface, but she's always ready, bracing with her feet against surfaces and trying to unbalance me while she hissed and bit at the back of my neck. </p>

<p>I should have learned how dangerous Wulfs are up close by now. My experiences from the East-sea had made my overconfident, West-sea Wulfs were far more dangerous. </p>

<p>Its when I try to reach for her head to pry her loose from a stinging bite that she made her move. She locked her legs around my torso and pinned my arms suddenly. For being such a smaller Wulf, she had surprising leg-strength. Then came the inevitable greedy wet engulf of my head from behind. Though i've seen Wulfs pull this move before, its another to experience one. Blinded, restrained and humiliated I could naught but bumble about her cabin, knocking furniture over while she worked her jaws over my head and neck with fast rhythmic swallows. </p>

<p>I tried to headbutt into walls, but found myself tripping as he prehensile tail wrapped around my legs and after that I was pretty much out of the fight. Only able to moan and squirm in frustration on the ground as Viska consumed me. </p>

<p>Inevitably, I filled out her gut with my curled up heavy form just like she had wanted. She lingered on swallowing down my feet, I could feel and hear her happily purr smug self-satisfaction as she took her time to finish me off, paws playing with my tail. I kicked my feet around in her jowls unhappily until the the gulp came and my fate was sealed. </p>
</div>

<div class="thunk hidden"><Strong>Try a Head-thunk</strong>
<p>I take a casual step forward. I can see her tense up at my approach immediately. I do not give her time to plan much or react, I see her cast a glance toward a rope dangling by the wall of her seat, most likely an alarm-bell. </p>

<p>But her hesitation is what makes my sudden head-ringing blow from a paw all the more devastating. No doubt Wulfs, especially one as young as her, has never heard of the martial art of “Punching” that all recruits of the academy are taught in nowdays.</p>

<p>She staggers, whimpers and looses strength in her knees, clutching her head. A follow-up blow is not necessary, I easily grab her by her scruff and pin her arm behind her back. </p>

<p>“ooooOOww...” She complains in a muted whine, no doubt her world is spinning. “Awe-fight deal-break, truce-break!” Her Wulfish is thick and slurred, I barely make out what she's saying, but get the gist of it.</p>

<p>“Sorry Viska.” I wasent really sorry. “Im tired of your “deals”. Here's one for you: Give me the intel, or i'll eat you.”</p>

<p>“Neverrrr! Eeek” Her defiant yell is cut short as she yanked up suddenly, towards my waiting gape.</p>

<p>“Your choice!” I shoved her into my jaws, clamping shut on her head before she could scream. </p>

<p>She kicked and squirmed worse then a crazed hills-ferret, recovering quick from her daze, but i've consumed others of her kind before. I clung her to my chest while I worked my mouth down over her body, swallowing in large heavy gulps. Her muffled protests got increasingly lower as she sank into my body with ease, she was naught but morsel-sized after-all. </p>

<p>I had to untangle her prehensile tail from around me before I should shove her down with a push on her tush the rest of the way. It was satisfying to feel her go down my gullet, wiggling as she was. The last of her long tail slipped past my lips, flicking and flashing until the last. </p>

<p>I didnt have time to sit back and savor the moment. I immediately started to rummage through the chest and turning the furniture upside down and looking for hidden compartments in the wall. But to no avail, I could not find the real documents anywhere. She probably didnt even keep them in her room. </p>

<p>I had to judge it a lost cause, we'd have to make do without the information, I could still probably fulfill my other objectives. But first I had to get off this Wulf-ship in one piece. It'd be all the more harder to do any objectives if I got caught. Or got my ship and crew tangled into a battle before we even arrived the Thousand islands. </p>
</div>
<div class="sword hidden"><Strong>Draw sword</strong>

<p>I draw my sword suddenly. I see her bristling at the sight of it. She had daggers on the inside of her coat, which are an advantage in such close quarters as this little cabin. </p>

<p>I lunge for her, I dont quite intend to skewer her, but I almost do as she jumps unexpectedly. My attack seems to have caught her completely by surprise. She must not have realized how not all Awes are protocol and rules. </p>

<p>She scampers this way and that, barely deflecting my blows, growing increasingly nervous about feeling more cold iron. She has a nasty gash already that will leave a scar. </p>

<p>The fight is over as suddenly as it started, she looses her dagger from a hard blow and is unable to keep up with just one. I soon have her subdues under sword point, daring her to yell. She hisses angrily at me. </p>

<p>“Awe-fight deal-break, truce-break!” Her Wulfish is thick, I barely make out what she's saying, but get the gist of it.</p>

<p>“Sorry Viska.” I wasent really sorry. “Im tired of your “deals”. Here's one for you: Give me the intel, or i'll eat you.”</p>

<p>“Neverrrr! Eeek” Her defiant yell is cut short as she cringes under the pressing sword.</p>

<p>“Your choice!” I grabbed her around the neck with my other paw, holding her tight and shoved her into my jaws, clamping shut on her head before she can scream. </p>

<p>She kicked and squirmed worse then a crazed hills-ferret, but i've consumed others of her kind before. I dropped the sword briefly to cling her to my chest while I worked my mouth down over her body, swallowing in large heavy gulps. Her muffled protests got increasingly lower as she sank into my body with ease, she was naught but morsel-sized after-all. </p>

<p>I had to untangle her prehensile tail from around me before I should shove her down with a push on her tush the rest of the way. It was satisfying to feel her go down my gullet, wiggling as she was. The last of her long tail slipped past my lips, flicking and flashing until the last. </p>

</div>
<div class="sword2 hidden"><Strong>Draw sword</strong>
<p>I draw my sword suddenly, I see her bristling at the sight of it, her eyes had been on my sword as her daggers already out of her coat and in her paws. They'll be an advantage for her in the close quarters of this little cabin.</p>

<p>I lunge for her, but she seems to be one step ahead of me and jumps unexpectedly. Could something I said have tipped her off to my treachery? </p>

<p>She scampers this way and that, deflecting my blows, closing the distance more and more and acctually driving me backwards toward a corner. I manage to score a gash as I try to disarm her, but instead of dropping the dagger the flings it at me, painfully pinning a wing to the wall.</p>

<p>The fight is over as suddenly as it started, before I can recover from yanking the blade loose she pounces me hard and expertly jabs a blade in a nerve on my sword-arm causing me the drop the blade. </p>

<p>She was all over me after that, wrestling and climbing onto my back while I held on to her arm with the dagger. I would have flung her off if she hadent suddenly and brashly jammed her jaws over my head. </p>

<p>Its was normaly a foolish move to do mid-fight, but I found my arms pinned by her legs wrapped around my torso. And when I tried to move to head-butt against a wall, her prehensile tail tripped up my feet and we went down. Her onto her rump and me down her gullet. </p>

<p>I was mere able to moan and squirm in frustration on the ground as Viska consumed me. </p>

<p>Inevitably, I filled out her gut with my curled up heavy form just like she had wanted. She lingered on swallowing down my feet, I could feel and hear her happily purr smug self-satisfaction as she took her time to finish me off, paws playing with my tail. I kicked my feet around in her jowls unhappily until the the gulp came. </p>
</div>
<div class="leave hidden">

<div class="hidden" id="noIntel">
<p> I weighed my options. I could submit to her demands, loose myself or crew to her belly for these documents which might or might not contain useful information. </p>

<p> Or i could refuse to bow to her demands and just leave. We'll have to make do, sometimes it was better to just back away when a deal seemed too unfair. </p>

<p> "Thank you for your time Viska" I spoke softly and nodded. Viska looked perplexed. "I think i will have to turn you down. You may keep documents." </p>

<p> I rose smoothly and turned to leave, Viska said nothing, stumped and did not challenge me. </p>

<p> I returned to the ship where my crew were still dutifully lined up, eyeing the Wulf-crew which scampered about their ship or perched and stared back. My officers read my mood it seems, none asked how it went. I only needed to order them to undock and prepare to leave and they hastened to obey </p>
</div>
<div class="hidden" id="noIntelViska">
<p> I decided to act casual, despite the occasional kick and struggle under the fluff of my belly. I picked up my things and strode out of the cabin. I was unchallenged until i reached their main-deck. </p>

<p> A lanky Wulf with a long mane running down along his back stopped me, his eyes focused on mine rather then my shapely middle. </p>

<p> "Viska-captain give strength? Awe-captain forget paper?" His speech was clearer then Viskas, there was also no hiding of the suspicion in his voice.</p> 

<p> "She might have forgot to give it to me. Do you have it?" I ventured, it was worth a shot. </p> 

<p> "Talk-false, Truce-break! Viska-captain forget-not!" He hissed balefully and i saw the other nearby Wulfs tense, draw weapons and step closer. </p>

<p> With a motion of my paw i signaled my crew. They sprung into action immidiatly, drawing swords in unison while Raptorians rushed out from below deck, snarling and armored, ready for a fight. In this encounter, we were more prepared.</p>

<p> The Wulf-crew looked angry, but hesitant. They were outnumbered and without leadership. I strode past the ones blocking my way calmly and they let me pass. I passed over to my ship and didnt spare them another glance. I ordered us on our way. </p>

<p> This would no doubt become a diplomatic incident of some sort and a headache back home. But Viska altered a deal and i made her pay for it. Perhaps they will respect that in the end. </p>
</div>

<div class="hidden" id="withIntel">
<p> I strode back to my ship uncontested, documents safely stashed under my arm. The wulfs eyed me with a mix of suspicion and interest. Perhaps they were impressed to see someone get their way around their willfull young captain. </p>

<p> My officers were relieved to see me, still diligently waiting in ordered ranks. Things looked to have been quiet up here while i negotiated. But im sure they were glad to end the staring-contest and be on their way. </p>

<p> Our ships soon undocked and parted ways. I only glanced Viska striding along her deck, appearing to bark instructions to her crew. I understood slightly more now why they obeyed her. </p>
</div>

<div class="hidden" id="withIntelViska">
<p> I strode back to my ship mostly uncontested, documents safely stashed under my arm and rounded gut jostling lightly. The Wulfs stared at me hard, they looked surprised and slightly taken aback. A tall lanky Wulf with a long mane along his back briefly stepped forward to bar my way </p>

<p> "Viska... give strength to Awe-captain?" He sounded hesitant. Eyeing both the documents and my figure. </p>

<p> "Yes." I replied curtly, giving him a look of annoyance. He said no more, nodding once and stepped out of my way, it seems he believed me. I was relieved there would be no fuss.

<p> I strode back aboard my own ship and my officers looked relieved to see me and surprised at my additional prize. </p>

<p> "Things went well, prepare for departure!" Was all i said, feeling quite smug over the looks they gave me. </p>

<div class="sacrifice hidden"><Strong>Sacrifice a crewmember</Strong>
<p>It was a difficult choice. But in the end, the mission came first.. I sighed and nodded slowly. </p>

<p>“Alright, you'll get your meal. One of my crew for the documents.” I growled quietly. “But they better be worth this, or ill make sure you pay!”</p>

<p>“Viska would demand-not Viska-deal if paper valuable-not!” Viska grinned, pleased with herself and her bargaining skills no doubt.</p>

<p>“Your Awe-speech is terrible. You have a deal.” I sighed at her. </p>

<p>This was not going to be a popular decision, but my crew should obey, they were Admiralty-trained, everyone here knew what they signed up for, what sacrifices might be asked of them. It was all for the good of the home.</p>

<p>I ended up asking for volunteers, hiding no facts from my crew. Unsurprisingly there was no rush of people willing to do their duty. The spread of the Order and their beliefs of Awe spirits being sacred and belonging only to our own kin might be to blame.</p>

<p>But the surprising volunteer ended up being one of the crews few domestic Wulfs.</p>

<p>Sailor Yeorf, his reasons remained his own ask i asked him to confirm his decision. I made sure to note down high commendations for him in the log. It would net extra pension gains for his next of kin, not that Wulfs usually had many.</p>

<p>I also had the satisfaction of seeing Viska first object and then be very frustrated as I corrected her. </p>

<p>“Our deal was one of my crew, thats what you agreed to. Not all of my crew are Awes.” </p>

<p>We parted ways, our ships untangling from their temporary dock. The previously eager and ravenous young Wulf-captain was left looking sour and dissatisfied, despite the full gut stretching out her poorly buttoned up coat. </p>

<p>It was a minor victory in such a harsh deal. I fought not to smirk at her, I had lost a valuable crew-member to something that felt avoidable after all. </p>

</div>

<div class="viskasBelly hidden">
<p>With her belly bulging and sagging down from my weight and form, she marched us out of the cabin in a waddling slow pace. I had to groan at the cramped squelching confines of her stomach, I could not move. I was larger then her, but her body compressed me in close against her, I felt the muscles of her walk as it jostled me around from side to side in squeezing motions. </p>

<p>A crooning hoot went up, as her crew celebrated with approving sounds at their triumphant captain. No doubt she was quite a sight, slowly marching across her ship back towards ours with lazy casual superiority, flaunting her huge Awe-filled stomach. </p>

<p>She walked over the plank to my ship with no fear and a smirk on her face, not worried at all of the arrayed ranks of Awes staring at her with a mixture of aghast, outraged and curious looks.</p>

<p>I felt her squezze me then, she put both her paws against my form and pushed hard. The muscles contracted and I had to groan as she loudly and mockingly 'BEEEELCHED' into the air to fully mark her triumph. It silenced any growing muttering from my crew. She spoke up. </p>

<p>“Captains are captain. Awe is Wulf. In deal, this one agree to be Viska.” The young wulf patted on her belly, I felt the thump-thump of her paw. This was getting exceedingly humiliating. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>“Wulfs be mighty. Paper-deal yours now.” Someone tossed the precious folder of Intel from ship to ship. </p>

<p>Viska stood there, basking in the moment and silence that followed. She licked her lips slowly, looking about her at my crew and I felt her squezze me again as her stomach churned. </p>

<p>“Deal be done” She announced and leaned forward to heave me back up onto the deck of my ship. It was a slow affair, I certainly with easier in then out. </p>

<p>But drool covered and with my pride deflated I at least emerged intact and alive, the cadets were quick to help me onto my feet. </p>

<p> "Good favor, no? Getting to be in Viska and tell others!" She cackled like the little scamp she was. Viska marched back to her ship and quickly disappeared under deck, her fellow Wulf crew dissipated back to their duties, talking amongst themselves excitedly.</p>

<p>“There's always a price with Wulfs. This one was... cheap... considering whats in those papers.” I assured those around me as I got to my feet. </p>

<p>They nodded, they understood. But I could not meet their eyes.</p>

<p>Viska stood there, basking in the moment and silence that followed. She licked her lips slowly, looking about and basking in her own smugness and superiority. </p>

<p>“Deal be done” She announced and marched back toward her ship, carrying the former Awe-captain with her and leaving her former crew baffled and confused. </p>

<p> Viska retired to her cabin, to relax in her lounger and sleep off her new prize. Adding the Awe-captain to herself, absorbing her strength, would further cement her hold on the crew and her reputation. </p>

<p> Her stomach was soon loudly squelching and gurgling as she dreamed ambitious dreams.</p>

</div>

<div class="decline hidden"><strong>Decline</strong>
<p>
    “No thanks” I sighed and reached my paw for the important documents. Viska looked surly for a moment, but she handed them over nevertheless. I was starting to understand how she operated.
</p>
<p>
    “Why dont you be my meal instead Viska? A spry young wulf like you would be healthy supper.” I teased, two could play this game.
</p>
<p>
    “Ha! No-no! Awe-captain brave, but not Viska-strong!” She laughed, forgetting her surliness. It wasent what I expected but at this point I'd take it. I got what I came for.
</p>

<div class="declineNip hidden"><strong>Decline and...</strong>

<p>“No thanks” I sighed and reached my paw for the important documents. Viska looked surly for a moment, but she handed them over nevertheless. I was starting to understand how she operated. </p>

<p>“Why dont you be my meal instead Viska? A spry young wulf like you would be healthy supper.” I teased, I could play this game again. To my surprise she seemed to pause. </p>

<p>“Awe-strength big? How Avolc-captain beat Nipfang-captain?” She probed curiously. I saw no harm in retelling the tale. </p>

<p>We clashed ships and our crews fought hard. But in the end we met and agreed a duel would settle who'd be the victor, which captains strength belonged to who.</p>

<br />

<span class="hidden" id="declinesword">“I charged Nipfang with my sword, pressing the attack. We fought hard, blades clashing when suddenly his hook-blade disarmed me briefly...” Viska looked enthralled, nodding for me to keep going. “...but I was quick and dove after it. Nipfang was slow, didnt catch me and I suddenly turned and nicked his paw with a slice! “ I demonstrated the move with an imaginary swipe of my paw. </span>



<span class="hidden" id="declinetackle">“I charged Nipfang in a tackle. We fought hard a while, it seemed Nipfang had the advantage with his strong tail, but it was a trick!” I didnt mind embellishing the tale a little bit. It had been quite a desperate fight to take on a big Wulf in wrestle. “When sure of his victory, I turned it around, twisting and pinning Nipfang.” I demonstrated my maneuver on the air. </span>



<span class="hidden" id="declinedef">“I let him attack and swipe and swing with his hook-blade. I was patient and quick as he got tired and frustrated.” I grinned with smug remembrance. “I saw through his tricks and waited for him to drop his guard, then I struck!” I made a sudden jabbing motion in the air with an imaginary sword. </span>

<p>Viska nodded slowly, she could picture it. She didnt doubt me anylonger. </p>

<p>“Victory was mine. Nipfang submitted his strength and his crew followed.” I licked my chops and smirked at the young Wulf suggestively. Some of her brashness had gone out of her, her stature looked almost smaller then it had before. </p>

<p>“Awe-captain strong. Avolc-Awe impressive to Viska.” She spoke quietly, as if it took some effort to give praise. Truth be told it was surprising to hear. I really must have impressed her. </p>

<p>“Im glad you finally see that!”  I beamed, resisting to give her head a pat.</p>
</div>

<div class="accept hidden"><strong>Agree to be her meal</strong>
<p>The price of that intel was just too valuable for one Awes sake. I'd rather it be me then one of my crew to take the fall. Or plunge as it was. I nodded to Viska, agreeing to become her food. I always figured id end up on the hips of a Wulf, I hoped she would not be obnoxious about it. </p>

<p>“Yes? Mmm, good!” The young Wulf licked her lips enthusiastically and perched on her seat. The way she looked at me now, intently and hungrily, made me really feel all the more like a morsel then ever. But apparently thats what I had decided I was to her. </p>

<p>“Awe-captain Avolc knows where she belongs! Your strength and self become Viska now! It a good thing for both!” She rose from her chair and beckoned me over. “Come! I swallow you.” She yawned and extended her tongue. It seemed she meant to eat me right away. </p>

<p>I stood staring at her and her gape a while, im not sure what brought me to agree to feed myself to this brat of a Wulf. Was it really only for the mission? Was it that important? </p>

<p>Viskas tail lashed impatiently and I figured it was best not to leave her waiting and get things over with. </p>

<p>I placed my paws in her maw, leaned in and let her start to swallow me whole. I felt a jolt of doubt and apprehension through my spine, but the decision had been made. I... was committed.</p>

<p>Viska seemed briefly surprised, but soon she purred in self-satisfaction between greedy swallows, dragging me into her body. “Glk-glk-glk” soon filled my ears as my head passed over her tongue and into hot darkness. In her eagerness she consumed with ravenous need, pulling at my body as she shoveled me down her gullet, hat, cape, gear and all, choosing only at the last second to omit my sword. That was the one thing a Wulf could surely not digest!</p>

<p>The young Wulfesses belly must have grown and expanded considerably, drooping down with the sudden mass and weight added to it. She emitted a loud trilling yell of excitement as she took great relish in her growing form and Ego, biting dominantly at my feet as they slipped past into her jaws and vanished with a wet open-mouthed 'gluk' down the gullet. </p>

<p>It was over, I had submitted myself to her and her demands. Whether in service to the Admiralty or her dominant cocky youthful vigor, I... wasent sure, had she turned me? Her gloating would not wait. </p>

<p>“Annghh...” She groaned loudly, staggering back to her seat for a brief rest, paws caressing her engorged gut. “Miiiine...” she churrled in the characteristic sound of a pleased Wulf. Who could blame her.</p>


</div>
<div class="viska hidden"><strong>Sudden meal</strong>
<p> "So how about it? Going to become my strength or not?" I ventured, leaning forward toward her. "Take it or leave it!" I gaped my jaws at her and pointed in, like she had done to me. </p>

<p> I was not ready for her next move. She pounced toward me and literaly jammed herself into my jaws, squirming her way towards my gullet. I nearly fel over backwards as the little Wulf nearly force-fed herself to me, i had to swallow so not to choke! </p>

<p> It was unnerving how she could one moment been so adamant in her predatory views and the next turn over completely into submission. I swallowed around her squirming form, working her body down into my neck and chest. She had gone down so sudden and dry, it wasent entierly pleasant at first. </p>

<p> But soon enough she slid down with further ease, each squelching gulp merging her form with my growing waist. I groaned and unbuckled my belt, she deserved a little space for her willing contribution. </p>

<p> "Opph... phew... That was... unexpected." I chuckled and rubbed over my rounded form, the shape of her was muted by the poof of fur, but it was quite unmistakable what had happened. I wondered how the Wulf crew would react as i marched back to my ship with Documents in hand and their captain in my gut. </p>
