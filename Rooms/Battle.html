<p> Crew morale appears to be <span class="Crew-morale-description"><script>displayMoraleStatus()</script></span> </p>
<p> The ships status is: <span class="Ship-Health-description"><script>displayShipStatus()</script></span> </p>
--------------
<div id="story-text">
<p>The enemy ship is approaching rapidly. I say enemy because it has no discernable markings or banners to herald it allegiance or intent. </p>

<p> It appears to be of similar configuration to ours, a fast frigate or escort of some sort. No doubt where our hired ship-builders got their designs from. It would explain how they managed to approach so fast. While they're coming at us they don't seem to be heading straight for us, so they at the least don't seem to have plans to ram us. </p>

<p>We have some time, albeit short, to prepare for battle. I have two reserve units waiting below-deck for orders that can assist in the preparation if need be. </p>

<p>The forward ballista is being hastily assembled by experienced crew-awes. We could probably also get the rear one up in order just in time if I divert crew from other areas to work on it. </p>

<p>But I could instead assign the extra hands to help with the sails, that ought to give us a little more speed to maneuver with. </p>

<p>Lastly, I could simply have the reserves stand by, out of everyone's way and ready themselves for eventual melee and damage control. </p>

<div class="hidden" id="arnLives">Arn has graced the deck with his pressence. No matter what i think about him, he's still for better or worse the First-officer. Until that changes i might aswell make use of him.
<p>"Any oppinion on deployment First-officer?" I mutter to him calmly. He should tell by the tone im annoyed at his tardiness. </p>

<p> "We're not sure what we're up against Captain. Speed... might be prudent, in case we need it." Arn offers, glancing towards the sails. </p>
 </div>
 
<div class="hidden" id="arnDead">
<p> Despite everything that has happened, i wish i had a stout First-officer by my side now to help me prepare. My officers are doing good work. Even my cadets are diligently providing assistance in their assigned tasks. But i cant help but feel slightly alone </p>

<p> But in the end, its always up to the captain to make the final call anyway. </p>

<div class="ballista hidden"><strong>Ballista</strong>
<p>We need more firepower, on my order the parts for the second weapon start to make their way up. The crew have drilled well, it looks like they'll just about get it in working order before the enemy ship is in range. </p>

<p>If their ship is any bit as solidly built as ours, then the missiles fired from these wont do much to their hull. But we can still aim for critical points like sails, mast, rudder and even crew to give ourselves an advantage. Doubly so now with two weapons operational. </p>

<br />

<p>The ship is entering maneuvering range, still much too far out of weapons range, but close enough for us to adjust what kind of approach we want. We could charge in close aggressively, try to out-maneuver them and get on their tail or slug it out at range. </p>

<p>By the looks of it they might be opting for something close to the last two themselves. This are still simply approaching at an angle. </p>
</div>

<div class="sails hidden"><strong>Sails</strong>
<p>Speed, its what this ship is good for. But with extra crew helping with the sails we can be faster at switching between full and half sail tighten up our otherwise clumsy maneuvering. </p>

<p>Seeing as their ship is similar to ours, it might just be the edge we need in this fight to gain the advantage.</p>

<p>The ship is entering maneuvering range, still much too far out of weapons range, but close enough for us to adjust what kind of approach we want. We could charge in close aggressively, try to out-maneuver them and get on their tail or slug it out at range. </p>

<p>By the looks of it they might be opting for something close to the last two themselves. This are still simply approaching at an angle. </p>

</div>

<div class="standby hidden"><strong>Stand-by</strong>
<p>I order the extra crew to stand-by as reserves. You never know when and where you'll need them once things get heated. </p>

<p>They wont be entirely idle down there I am sure. They'll ready weapons for boarding and close-combat to be close at hand. Any determined ship battle tend to end in fire or a clash of brawn and bravery. </p>

<p>The ship is entering maneuvering range, still much too far out of weapons range, but close enough for us to adjust what kind of approach we want. We could charge in close aggressively, try to out-maneuver them and get on their tail or slug it out at range. </p>

<p>By the looks of it they might be opting for something close to the last two themselves. They are still simply approaching at an angle, perhaps im just paranoid and they want a good look at us. </p>

</div>

<div class="fire hidden"><strong>Contacts</strong>
<p>Figures are taking off from the advancing ship. Gryphs, about 20 of them are heading toward us, keeping themselves high in the air. I immediately recall the tale of captain Russel and his merchant ship, its very likely these gryphs have nothing pleasant do deliver. </p>

<p>A few choices stand out that need to be made quickly. </p>

<p>Get ready to fight fire or perhaps send a few spare crew to intercept and challenge them in the air. Or perhaps they're just a distraction, sent to harry us and worry us and commit our resources. I cant see any flames being carried. </p>

</div>
<div class="bucket hidden"><strong>Fighting fire</strong>
<p>The gryphs are carrying something, I see them carrying harnesses. Soon little points of light come falling down from the sky and shatter across the deck. There is an immediate conflagration of fire at these points and I see crew jumping out of the way with singed tails for those not fast enough. </p>

<p>I do not even have to shout for the damage-crew, they hastily rush up with buckets at the ready, pouring water onto the flames, working to quench the flames before they take.</p>

<p>Its not long before there's a near inferno on the ship! The fire seems to spread quickly and all over, despite everyone's hard work. </p>

<p>Its not until some Raptorians join in, stomping on the flames of some fresh impacts with feet and tails and managing to smoother them out that our mistake became obvious. The water were doing nothing but spreading the fire, whatever they were tossing down in those vials to shatter onto the deck made it immune to water.</p>

<p>With a change in tactic, sooty Awes managed to turn the tide on the flames. Nothing vital had caught fire, but the damage had been done, smoke and confusion was everywhere. </p>

<p>The gryphs are already returning to their ship, out of their little munitions. </p>

<p>At least they've now made their intentions abundantly clear. </p>

<p> It is our turn to make a move, hostilities are now confirmed! Through the choking smoke that covers the ship I order the plan of attack. The crew looks just as eager for some payback.</p>
</div>

<div class="intercept hidden"><strong>Intercept</strong>
<p>“Take flight! Stop them, dont let them come close!” I order quickly. </p>

<p>My officers dont need to be coddled with orders. Sharp and quick, crossbows are readied and passed along. Flight worthy Awes from the reserves climb the masts to the peaks to be ready to leap off and do their best in the air. </p>

<p>I watch from below as the Gryphs come swooping in. They're met with bolts and bodies, brave Awes moving in to block their approach in the air. </p>

<p>Its quickly obvious our fliers are no match to the larger and quicker Gryphs. When wing meets wing, our brave Awes quickly tire at maintaining altitude and need but a rough shove or kick to loose much of it. </p>

<p>Many are forced to glide back to the ship and re-climb the masts, panting heavily to leap back into the combat. </p>

<p>But between them and the sniping bolts whistling in the air towards them, the sheer press of bodies and their intensity in defending the ship appear to be keeping the Gryphs at bay and from keeping their payload from hitting their ships. I spot a few objects fall short and into the water or smash against the outer hull in a burst of flame, but nowhere where they'd pose a threat. </p>

<p>The gryphs are already returning to their ship, chased off or out of their munitions. Its a good thing i kept those extra reserves ready, numbers seem to have prevailed. </p>

<p>At least they've now made their intentions abundantly clear. </p>

<p> It is our turn to make a move, hostilities are now confirmed! I order the plan of attack, feeling tingle of excitement of oncomming battle. The crew looks just as eager for some more closer action.</p>

</div>

<div class="interceptFail hidden"><strong>Intercept</strong>
<p>“Take flight! Stop them, dont let them come close!” I order quickly. </p>

<p>My officers dont need to be coddled with orders. Sharp and quick, crossbows are readied and passed along. Flight worthy Awes from the reserves climb the masts to the peaks to be ready to leap off and do their best in the air. </p>

<p>I watch from below as the Gryphs come swooping in. They're met with bolts and bodies, brave Awes moving in to block their approach in the air. </p>

<p>Its quickly obvious our fliers are no match to the larger and quicker Gryphs. When wing meets wing, our brave Awes quickly tire at maintaining altitude and need but a rough shove or kick to loose much of it. </p>

<p>Many are forced to glide back to the ship and re-climb the masts, panting heavily to leap back into the combat. </p>

<p>Soon thrown objects make it through the attempted blockade and shatter against the deck in bursts of flame. There's not enough of them up there to make a difference in the end. </p>

<p>I have to jump to the side and bat at my fur as something that looks like a burning vial shatters right next to me and instantly combusts. They seem to contain some sort of flammable liquid. </p>

<p>An eager sailor is quick to pour a bucket of water over the burning spot, but in doing so he only seems to wash the flames around which continue burning and putting things alight. </p>

<p>I curse and look around, similar mistakes are done elsewhere and before I can shout myself hoarse on getting a stop too it and get things under control, smoke and confusion fills the air. </p>

<p>The gryphs are already returning to their ship, out of their little munitions. </p>

<p>At least they've now made their intentions abundantly clear. </p>

<p> It is our turn to make a move, hostilities are now confirmed! Through the choking smoke that covers the ship I order the plan of attack. The crew looks just as eager for some payback.</p>
</div>

<div class="wait hidden"><strong>Wait</strong>
<p>There only appear to be 20 or so of them as I do a quick count. There is little they could do to threaten our ship with that number. If they try to assault us we'd quickly swarm them with numbers. </p>

<p>I order the crew in the sails to be ready and wary, but other then that I have the crew stand by. </p>

<p>The gryphs soon swoop in, dropping objects that look alight towards the ship. Flames soon explode out of the impacts from the objects. I have to jump aside, nearly singed, as what appears to be a vial shatters onto the deck right next to me and combusts into flames. </p>

<p>Its not a very big conflagration and I soon see more of these spots of fire blossom everywhere. Damage control crew are slow to respond, I never ordered them to be readied. But they are on the move now. </p>

<p>But by the time they manage to haul water towards the flames, the fire is already sputtering out. Infact, the places that were quick to react have a harder time of it, as the water spreads the flames rather then puts it out. </p>

<p>Our tardiness turns out to be to our advantage this time. </p>

<p>The gryphs are already returning to their ship, out of their little munitions. </p>

<p>Atleast they've now made their intentions abundantly clear. </p>

<p> It is our turn to make a move, hostilities are now confirmed! I order the plan of attack, feeling tingle of excitement of oncomming battle. The crew looks just as eager for some action.</p>
</div>

<div class="advice hidden"><strong>Benefit of foreknowledge</strong>
<p>Things are looking very much like the tale of Captain Russel. Im starting to strongly suspect this was the ship that attacked him. </p>

<p>If so, we are in for a bit of fire from those Gryphs. But we wont make the same mistake our merchant friends did. This time I order the reserves ready to put out flames, without the use of water. </p>

<p>When the inevitable projectiles come raining down onto the ship, shattering and combusting into flames, crew already stand ready to put them out. Smothering the flames with heavy blankets or using Sand. It works effectively and the flames are quickly put out without causing any damage. </p>

<p>I smirk as the gryphs circle above a few times before returning to their ship, out of their little munitions. </p>

<p>At least they've now made their intentions abundantly clear. </p>

<p> It is our turn to make a move, hostilities are now confirmed! I order the plan of attack, feeling tingle of excitement of oncomming battle. The crew looks just as eager for some action.</p>

</div>

<div class="approach hidden"><strong>Aggressive approach</strong>

<p>I order us to charge into close range. They seem a bit shy in their approach so going in close might not be in their favor. </p>

<p>The forward ballista readies itself to fire, there is still a good way to go before they can aim at anything worthwhile. </p>

<p>The enemy ship is close enough now that I can see figures moving on their deck. There is also a peculiar thing...</p>

<p>A flash, smoke. It looks like something exploded on their ship. Its follow by a thundering 'THOOM'. </p>

<p>Before anyone in the crew or myself am able to react or process what happened, hull explodes into splinters and debris on our forward starboard side of the ship. Sending unfortunate awes tumbling backwards in yells and shrieks. </p>

<p>We were hit with something! Something strong enough to damage and even puncture the hull! Crew look dazed, some pick up help the wounded limp below deck. </p>

<p>Another flash and 'THOOM' draws my attention back from the damage. Something whistles by in the air loudly, just above the main deck, narrowly missing a mast and tearing a circular hole through one of the sails. </p>

<p>The crew look to me for instructions, fear on many of their faces. This was new and terrifying. </p>

</div>


<div class="manouver hidden"><strong>Manouver</strong>
<p>Charging in or staying at a safe enough distance do not feel like the right approach. One is too aggressive and the other too cautious. Like pieces on a playing-board we have to use our ship to the fullest and pin down our foe. </p>

<p>I order the sails tightened for a burst of speed, I intend to fling us past them quickly and then come around behind them and try to stay on them. </p>

<p>As we speed on by outside weapons-range the enemy ship is close enough now that I can see figures moving on their deck. There is also a peculiar thing...</p>

<div class="range hidden"><strong>Keep Range</strong>
<p>We'll test their mettle at range first. I have trust in the sturdiness of this ship from the journey here. The ballista crews stand ready, I do not need to tell them what to aim at. They know their weapons better then me. </p>

<p>I keep a close eye on the enemy ship. Its getting closer now, I can see figures moving on their deck. There is also a peculiar thing...</p>

<div class="retreat hidden"><strong>Retreat</strong>

<p>They have some devastating weapons we have no information about, it out-ranges us and out-guns us. This would explain why ships go missing without a trace. Who could stand a chance against anything like this!?</p>

<p>We can not stay, we have to try to escape before damage becomes insurmountable. I quickly order the ship around, full sails up. The weapons seem to be side-mounted on starboard side. We're close enough now that I can see figures working on a black tube of some sort. There appears to be two of them. Luckily they appear to take a long time to load. </p>

<p>I feint our ship towards port in favor of the wind and order our sails prepared for half-sail. Its the obvious escape route and what would get us most speed. They anticipate our move, moving to turn along with us and keep us in their firing arch. I grin and turn the ship suddenly hard starboard, crew pulling up the sails to give us a better turn. </p>

<p>We are outside their firing arch for now. Sails again on full but somewhat against the wind. </p>

<p>The enemy ship is turning, but much slower and on full sails, this will take them on a much wider turn. </p>

<p>We've bought some time and distance. But they're still in range if they decide to turn their broadside and shoot again. But unless they hit somewhere critical weshould be able to outfly them. </p>

<p>There is only so much the few brave diligent sailors in the sails, which so much depend on, can do. They can barely keep up with my alternating orders and we do not gain as much speed as fast as i'd hoped. <p>

<p>We might be out of their firing arch for now, but the enemy ship is turning and we'll be in line of sight sooner then i'd hoped. </p>

<p> We are closing distance fast, the weapons seem to be side-mounted on starboard side. We're close enough now that I can see figures working on a black tube of some sort. There seems to be two of them. Luckily they appear to take a long time to load.  </p>

<p> The enemy ship is wisely doing its best to maintain distance however, drawing out the time it'll take to close our ships. Luckily, if they are to stay out of range, they have to turn around and loose their firing arc pretty soon. </p>

<p>'TWANG' goes the ballista, it seems the forward crew that were nearly hit by the first impact have maintained their wits about them. The bolt sails through the air harmlessly hits their mainmast just behind their weapons. The bolt is stuck there and a reminder that we can shoot back </p>

<p>The response is another loud 'THOOM' of their weapons. I hardly need to shout for the crew to take cover, they all dive to the deck. </p>

<p>The shot rips through several sails and rigging, causing the top left part of the main sail to sag and flutter. Several crew fall towards the deck but are luckily able to break their fall with outspread wings and safety harnesses. </p>

<p>'THOOM' goes the second weapon. It hits the bow of the ship, where we are the most armored. The whole ship seems to shudder with the impact but there is no immediate sign of damage. If it breached the hull im sure someone will be along to tell me about it soon. </p>

<p> We are at a ranged stand-off, our own ballistas are in range too and twanging away their shots with an air of desperation. We are severely out-gunned but getting closer and giving them a bigger target for some apptempted manouvering or charging seems foolhardy. From those innitial shots, they dont seem to be very fast-loading or accurate, so we have that over them. </p>

<p> I can see some of our shots impacting their ships. I've left ammuntion choice and target up to each ballista officer so far and see no reason to change it as they're aiming for the enemy weapons. </p>

<p>They are probably thinking we're going to still ram them and take the fight into a closer melee. For a while i keep up that ruse, up until the moment stey start steering away from us to maintain distance and keep their weapon advantage. I turn us the other way, seemingly just in time, as their weapons blossom in fire and smoke once more.</p>

<p> 'BOOM!' goes the first, our tight turn sends the shot wide, whistling through the air with a sound that no doubt would haunt many dreams tonight if we survive. </p>

<p> The second shot, loud and echoing 'THOOM', overcompensates and this merely shot grazes us. But wood explodes nevertheless from the glancing hit and sends a minor explosions of splinters into my cowering crew, some of who fall over clutching injuries. </p>

<p>“KEEP COURSE! STAND FIRM!” I shout to maintain discipline. The crew must not give in to despair and flight. "We are doing well so far!" I try to encourage. </p>

<p> The 'TWANG' of ballista shots returning fire are somewhat reassuring to hear. But in the face of such superior firepower im unsure what good they can do. I keep order course directions to Nyxie at the helm, they atleast seem to only to be able to fire in one direction thats one advantage in our favor. </p>

<p> They fire again, loud thunder echoes as one of the shots appear to come short, but it skips over the water and lodges itself into the hull with a shuddering crash. </p>

<p> "That was at the waterline, go check for leaks!" I bellow at a cadet hovering nearby at a hatch, defying their order to stay below deck in battle.

<p> The next whistling shot was devastating. A loud crack told of a impact above and i had barely enough time to look up and see the top half of our main-mast come crashing down! </p>

<p> Loud cries and desperate shouts followed as Awes dove for cover when sails, rope and a heavy piece of mast crashed against the deck. I gave it all some less flattering curses, having escaped getting smooshed just barely! </p>

<p> Arn was shouting loudly at the sail-crew, working desperatly along with them to muster more speed out of our sail by keeping them taut and making sure any holes or rips are patched or replaced.</p>

<p> I must admit im impressed, i've never quite seen him work so hard before. Self-preservation really brings out the best in him and im forced to smirk admist the danger and desperation. Whether nearby crew found that unnerving or comforting I cared not </p>

<p>“Silence those weapons! Hop too it! Attack!” I waved my sword in the direction of the ship, which was doing its best to try to maneuver and keep itself from being crashed into. But we were close enough for my crew to leap over. I could see the figures on the enemy ship clearer now, Gators. They were large reptiles, similar to Raptorians but far more bulky, armored and rotund. </p>

<p>A mass of eager crew leap on over from the masts already, descending on the enemy ship with Mid-Officer Garsh in the lead. It would be a very hard fight, if they were anywhere as tough as a Raptorian but despite all that happened their spirits were not broken! Said Raptorians i knew waited eagerly for the command to charge as we locked ships. Right now they were of little use and stayed out of the way. </p>

<p>BOOM! One of the weapons fired at near point blank range. The shot crashed straight through the side of our ship and out the other. It knocked me off my feet hard, not only that, we were suddenly off course, loosing distance. Too far to further assault and back up those who already leapt over. I could see them fighting in a tight knot by the enemy weapons, they had landed right ontop of them, preventing them from firing further. </p>

<p>“Permission to join the fight, captain.” I wheeled around to see my three grim-faced scouts, cloaks tossed aside and impressive wings on display. </p>

<p>“Buy them time! I will close the gap.” I nodded in assent. They immediately leap and take flight, speeding above the water to join the fighting. </p>

<p>High-Officer Nyxie at the helm was already compensating, getting us closer again. Our ballista kept firing with sharp Twangs, they were doing their best to cover the surrounded crew. </p>

<p>We seem to arrive back in range just in time, our few attackers leap over the side and glide back in retreat before I can order reinforcements for them. The gator ship is full of armored and armed gators now, any further glide attacks would be sending our Awes to their doom. </p>

<p>Some are already wounded and missing, not all manage to glide all the way and are tossed ropes and rescue floats to be hauled out of the sea. </p>

<p> But it seems that whatever they managed to do over there was enough to drive them back. The gators are hoisting full sails, making a break for it while i order us to slow down to pick up our crew. I will not abandon anyone to the cold sea.</p>

<p>“Permission to join the fight, captain.” I wheeled around to see my three grim-faced scouts, cloaks tossed aside and impressive wings on display. </p>

<p>“Buy them time! I will close the gap.” I nodded in assent. They immediately leap and take flight, speeding above the water to join the fighting. </p>

<p>High-Officer Nyxie at the helm was already compensating, getting us closer again. Our ballista kept firing with sharp Twangs, they were doing their best to cover the surrounded crew. </p>

<p>We seem to arrive back in range just in time, our few attackers leap over the side and glide back in retreat before I can order reinforcements for them. The gator ship is full of armored and armed gators now, any further glide attacks would be sending our Awes to their doom. </p>

<p>Some are already wounded and missing, not all manage to glide all the way and are tossed ropes and rescue floats to be hauled out of the sea. </p>

<p> But it seems that whatever they managed to do over there was enough to drive them back. The gators are hoisting full sails, making a break for it while i order us to slow down to pick up our crew. I will not abandon anyone to the cold sea.</p>

</div>

<div class="boardLow hidden"><strong>A clash of arms</strong>
<p>“We are close enough!” I shout over the din of noise to be heard over the whole ship while I rushed over the deck, signaling my officers that it was time to attack, indeed now or never. </p>

<p>“Silence those weapons! Hop too it! Attack!” I waved my sword in the direction of the ship, which was doing its best to try to maneuver and keep itself from being crashed into. But we were close enough for my crew to leap over. I could see the figures on the enemy ship clearer now, Gators. They were large reptiles, similar to Raptorians but far more bulky, armored and rotund. </p>

<p>Crew leap over, led by Mid-Officer Garsh. But i can tell he has trouble leading them. Morale is low, understandably so, a lot of whats happened has been a shock. It would be a very hard fight, if they were anywhere as tough as a Raptorian. Said Raptorians i knew waited eagerly for the command to charge as we locked ships. Right now they were of little use and stayed out of the way. </p>

<p>BOOM! One of the weapons fired at near point blank range. The shot crashed straight through the side of our ship and out the other. It knocked me off my feet hard, not only that, we were suddenly off course, loosing distance. Too far to further assault and back up those who already leapt over. I could see them fighting desperatly against near hopeless odds, backs to the sea. They had landed close to the weapons, preventing them from firing further, for now. </p>

<p>“Permission to join the fight, captain.” I wheeled around to see my three grim-faced scouts, cloaks tossed aside and impressive wings on display. </p>

<p>“Buy them time! I will close the gap.” I nodded in assent. They immediately leap and take flight, speeding above the water to join the fighting or at least help out however they can. </p>

<p>High-Officer Nyxie at the helm was already compensating, getting us closer again. Our ballista kept firing with sharp Twangs, they were doing their best to cover the surrounded crew. </p>

<p>We seem to arrive back in range just in time, our few attackers leap over the side and glide back in retreat before I can order reinforcements for them. The gator ship is full of armored and armed gators now, any further glide attacks would be sending our Awes to their doom. </p>

<p>Only a fraction make it back to the ship, Garsh is missing, most who escape the gators clutched do not manage to glide all the way and are tossed ropes and rescue floats to be hauled out of the sea. </p>

<p>Whatever damage they managed to do over there it doesent seem like enough. There is bustling around the weapon devices that have been responsible for the thunder and damage. We might only have bought ourself a moments respite at great cost. </p>

</div>

<div class="explosion hidden"><strong>Explosion!</strong>
<p> Something bright streaks toward the enemy ship and thwangs dead-center on their hull, I see our rear ballista has changed ammunition to incendiary. I refrain from telling them that they cant hope to light them on fire like that, they probably know their jobs. </p>

<p> We are close enough now that i can make out that the figures on the enemy ship are mostly Gators. Could it be the empire on the warpath then after all? But i do not recognize any markings, flags or insignia. Gators on the warpath are far from subtle, they tend to want you to know who's beating them. </p> 

<p> We've ended up circling each other, they do not want us to close the gap too much, afraid of loosing the edge their weapon provides mayhaps. Our ballistas are hammering them, i can see our forward piece has already done good work sabotaging their sails with repeated fire, slowing them down. Im unsurprised to see Gryphs, no doubt mercenaries or conscripts, swooping to and fro to undo the damage. </p>

<p> I cant quite remember what i was yelling at some bumbling crew, for what happened next threw everyone down violently. One moment a streak of light from our rear ballista it landed among the enemy crew fussing and loading their odd weapons, the next, a dramatic explosion, followed by the loudest thunderclap, sent a wall of wind at us as fire consumed their ship in a large blooming ball of heat and light. </p>

<p> My ears rang as i clutched the deck, the force of it rocked our ship back hard and tore some sails loose from the mast. All was confusion for several moments until i got back on my feet and was able to assess the situation. </p>

<p> Someone was cheering. The rear ballista crew were hooting and soon the rest of the dazed crew joined, raising paws in the air at the enemy ship that had seemed to have broken in two, both pieces on fire and breaking apart further. </p>

</div>

<div class="victory hidden"><strong>Victory!</strong>
<p> Somehow we had won. </p>

<p> Things were in a bit of a chaos at first, the explosion had left our sails in a mess, but luckily not torn them apart. We had been very close to the other ship when it blew. I had almost considered ordering boarding hooks to be readied. </p>

<p> It took a while to puzzle out what had happened, but my ballistic officer, an ecstatic Officer Ulv quickly filled me in. </p>

<p> "I was watching them real close, they weres filling them tubes between shots right." Ulv grinned, she was from the same region as Ziggy i guessed by her maner of speech. </p>

<p> "With what?" I interrupted, more wondering out loud, but she took it as an inquiry. </p>

<p> "Couldnt tell ya, Admiral!" She shrugged. "But i figured it was what made it go 'BOOM' all loud-like". </p>

<p> "Mmm" I nodded. It had looked like they were fussing around quite a bit between shots, but i never had the time for a closer look like Ulv had. </p>

<p> "So we figured, right, what if we put some fire on tha stuff they're pouring in! So we did! Got it straigt on the second shot, aimed it meself, quite the show!" </p>

<p> "You've done well, more then well. You might have saved our fluff!" I gave Ulv a hard slap on her shoulder and she beamed proudly. </p>

<p> "Wasent all me, Admiral! Me crew did well too!" </p>

<p> "I'll see you all commended, but you most of all." I sent her on her way with a salute. Despite a devastating sudden victory, we had taken quite some damage from just a few hits of this new weapon. There was work to be done.  </p>

<p> We tried to recover as much of the enemy ship we could. But whatever worthwhile there had been had sunk to the bottom of the sea. Of the enemy crew there was unsuprisingly little trace. </p>

<p> Look-outs had claimed to report seeing a few gryphs escape the blast and fly off, but as good a flyers as they may be, this was the open sea. Our scouts which took a few laps in the air around the ship reported no sightings of land or other ships for them to fly too. </p>

<p> Somehow we had won. </p>

<p> Things were in a bit of a chaos at first, the explosion had left our sails in a mess, but luckily not torn them apart. Awes were still in the water, some dazed and confused and rescues were being done. </p>

<p> It took a while to puzzle out what had happened, but my ballistic officer, an ecstatic Officer Ulv quickly filled me in. </p>

<p> "I was watching them real close, we were giving cover with the remaining ballista." Ulv grinned, she was from the same region as Ziggy i guessed by her maner of speech. </p>

<p> "Whatever those barrels were filled with it was highly flamable! Like oil but more so! Once the contents started burning, it went woosh! And then it spread to the other barrels and that was more of a KABOOM. Glad ya had the sense to order everyone to jump, or you'd be crisps!" </p>

<p> Despite a devastating sudden victory, we had taken considerable damage from the battle. There was much work to be done just to make sure we did not sink from the next big wave. </p>

<div class="victory2 hidden"><strong>Victory!</strong>
<p> The enemy ship is in retreat. </p>

<p> Im still stunned at our sudden victory. The crew really pulled through bravely in face of such danger. </p>

<p>Soon I receive a report from Garsh, limping and supported by a scout. </p>

<p>“Their weapons are disabled. They were VERY protective of them. So much so that they dared not fully advance while we held them. They were made out of Iron captain, we could not smash them. But we smashed what we could, supports and such. We also scattered black powder all around from barrels, thats what made them really mad and forced us to flee. “</p>

<p>“You are to be commended for this Officer Garsh, you and all those who fought with you! Now go get yourself seen too.” I gave him a pat on the shoulder and he threw a quick salute and limped down below-deck.</p>

<p>I glanced up at fast retreating ship, we are safe for now. We could pursue them, but for now I dont wish to push our luck further. We've also taken an amount of damage and injuries yet to be assessed. </p>

<p> "Officer Tung did not make it. That we succeeded at all were thanks to him! He inspired the crew to fight harder, jumped into the thick of them with no fear! We'd have been overwhelmed if it were not for him." Garsh speaks urgently. I nod firmly to him and sent him to the infirmary. Whatever differances i might have had with Tung in the past, he was a great officer. </p>

<p>I glanced up at fast retreating ship, we are safe for now. We could pursue them, but for now I dont wish to push our luck further. We've also taken an amount of damage and injuries yet to be assessed. </p>


</div>
<div class="defeat hidden"><strong>In the face of defeat</strong>

<p> We were not entierly dead in the water, but we could no longer escape nor attack. Whatever we did, they could catch us or out-pace us as it was right now </p>

<p> I growled and bristled, there were not many options left to me. I considered briefly laying a trap, hide most of the crew under deck like that Wulf-ship had to us back in the east sea. </p>

<p> It would have been a sound idea, but they did not leave us to make plans, they came after us, lined themselves up and blasted their weapons at us again. The shots were carefuly aimed, seems they were interested in our ship, but not so much in us. </p>

<p> Projectiles exploded through hull above the waterline or against the decks, each shot was devastating and meant injury for anyone nearby. I had never imagined our ship being turned against us with these wooden splinters flying everywhich way. A report came from below that crew compartments were hit and most of the Raptorians were incapacitated. </p>

<p> I only had the option to surrender or mount some final desperate attack. I've heard rumours of the appetites of Gators and i was not keen on confirming them with my crew. </p>

<p> But all choices looked bleak and the ruthless and carefuly aimed bombardment continued.</p>
</div>

<div class="fireloss hidden"><strong>Smoke thickens</strong>
<p>The smoldering fires across the ship are producing a thick smoke, one covers the bridge deck with a cloying choking smoke. Damage-control awes, all black with soot and looking like a bunch of Raveneyes are only just now getting things in check. </p>

<p>Coughing I move away from the bridge and try to bellow out the orders to change our plan of attack. But my voice is raspy and does not carry! Only Nyxie at the helm responds, turning the ship. But the Awes in the sails are not quite fully informed and the sails start to flutter and and waver in the sudden course correction. </p>

<p>“THOOM” goes the blast of the enemies weapons. Two solid shots one after another rip through the hull, causing the boards under my feet to quiver and groan as if in pain. </p>

<p>There's confusion all around, a hint of panic hangs overhead as each moment only seems to bring us closer to ultimate disaster. </p>

<p>“Get those sails in order!” I hoarsely yell up a mast futilely. </p>

<p>“Captain! Captain where are you!?” I hear a yell from the bridge deck and I hurry back quickly. </p>

<p>“Report!” I croak hoarsly, but must have made up for the weakness in my voice with a fierce scowl, for the drenched Awe sailor before me balks at the sight of me. </p>

<p>“L-leak in lower holds! We're taking in a lot of water! We could not stop it and are working on sealing it off.”</p>

<p>“Carry on...” I nod and look over to the next Awe standing in line with fresh bad news. </p>

<p>“Ulv reports she cant get a bead on them with all this smoke. Ballista two is effectively out of commission.”</p>

<p>“Then help throw anything still smoking overboard instead!” I bark and grit my teeth. </p>

<p>We are too far away to make any kind of boarding assault still, they are playing keep away. </p>

</div>

<div class="surrender hidden"><strong>Surrender</strong>

<p> It was with heavy and bitter heart that i ordered the hoisting of the white flag and the lowering of our sails. They had bombarded us 3 more times until they were satisfied. By then there was not much fight left in the crew left standing. Reports from below deck told of grim injuries in the infirmary. </p>

<p> With their weapons aimed at our hull, they carefuly approached and captured us. The leering toothy maws of Gators greeted us, they were brutish looking reptiles, in some ways similar to Raptorians, but far more bulky, armored and rotund. </p>

<p> They barked deep guttural speech and took nothing to chance, overwhelming the ship quickly in a charge and captured us. I realized now what had been happening across the west sea. All those dissapearances. Did they all tell a similar tale? </p>

<p> To my horror it seemed the rumours of Gator appetite were not unfounded either. While securing the ship the bulky and armored reptiles did not balk at snatching the occasional morsel, shoving kicking and yelping crewmembers into their snouts and gulping them down. It was not methodical, it seemed merely a random indulgance of the occasional gator. </p>

<p> I made a loud objection at this. Shouting at the grunts who so far seemed to have ignored me. I could see no one in charge and chose to kick at the knee of a greedy Gator gobbling down one of my cadets. </p>

<p> All i got for this was a perplexed glance in my direction, as they made no pause in swallowing a heavy bulge down and then with a shrug i too was roughly grabbed and shoveled into the same jaws! </p>

<p> Perhaps he'd thought i'd volunteered and was impatiant for my turn. That in our passive surrender, we'd offered ourselves up as peace-offerings. It was hard making objections when a large tongue was squashed against your face and squelched you down into a dark muscled gatorgullet. </p>

<p> This was no way to treat a surrendering captain, there should have been some form of negotiation! My kicking did for some poor negotiating however and with a backward tilt of his head and loud 'Ghuul-uurrrp' he sent me sliding down into that rotound gut of his, further swelling the figure. </p>

</br> 

<p> The same thing happened around the ship. Anyone offering the least bit of objection or resistance were quickly swallowed up  by greedy jowls until eventualy some form of victory was announced and the gator-commander stepped aboard his new prize. </p>

<p> A ship and more slaves to savor then they knew what to do with. It had been a good haul and fight! Any resistance now grumbled away in low 'glouurgh's in the guts of his warriors. </p>

</div>

<div class="surrender2 hidden"><strong>Desperate attack</strong>

<p> There was only one way to reach the enemy ship. It was a last-ditch attack that I ordered simply to get the crew moving and remove that pitiful dejection and defeat out of their eyes.  </p>

<p> I roared my orders, calling everyone to their duties who were able too. We were assaulting that ship no matter what! And the only way to do so was to float there from the top of our remaining masts. </p>

<p> Its a form of boarding attack thats in the book, but often not one prefered, especially at these distances. But it was one everyone had drilled and knew the manouvers for. I kept them moving and hustling so they would not consider the shere desperation of it. </p>

<p> Shots still came whistling in, but they had somehow lost their edge and shock. Though they might have thrown some to the ground or sent vital pieces of the ships shattering. We had a goal and purpose in mind now. </p>

<p> I climbed with them and in quick succession ordered them to leap from the mast and glide toward the enemy ship. In knots of 3-4, brave Awes, regardless of flight-capability score assaulted the enemy. They might have suspected what was going on, they started to turn and put distance between us before even half of us were in the air. By then I too was gliding over, wings outspread and aching terribly </p>

<p> A third made it across clean to land on the enemy deck. Mostly those of high flight-scores, males and scouts. Another third clambered or bounced off the side of their vessel while the rest made a cold wet landing just short of the hull of the ship. Awes are not the best of swimmers, there were yelps and desperate floundering. A large portion resign themselves to just tread water and float. 

<p> By the time i climb onto the deck of the enemy ship, i realize its over before we even had a chance. Gators were large brutish looking reptiles, in some ways similar to Raptorians, but far more bulky, armored and rotund. Such a disorganized attack could never have succeeded, deep down i knew it all along. But it beat hoisting the white flag. </p>

<p> They were almost leisurely beating my poor crew into submission, surrounding them with numbers, positioning and mass. Brave fighters were knocked over by heavy blows, snatched up and devoured in sometimes as few as 3 gulps. My numerous crew were quickly vanishing into those swollen scaly bellies. </p>

<p> I led a small charge against someone who looked like a officer, atleast judging by the armor. My assesment was correct, with little honor the commander relied on his bodyguards to gang up on me, hardly sparing me a glance as he leered bemused at the spectacle of our pitiful attack. </p>

<p> Wide-open toothy jaws greeted me and i tried to brace against the corners of those jaws. But with a guttural grunt and hard shove i was plunged headfirst into a gators muzzle, violently toss-gulped down in haste and no savoring so to be able to snatch the next meal. </p>

</br>

<p> A gatorgut can be spaceous, until it gets crowded, which it quickly got.</p>

Awes are not the best of swimmers, there were yelps and desperate floundering. A large portion resign themselves to just tread water and float. 

<p> By the time i climb onto the deck of the enemy ship i realize the battle is in full swing. My Awes are fighting ferociously, with the kind of desperate fury a cornered Awe might exibit when that instinctual beast deep down in them takes over. </p>

<p> I spot Arn and Tung, side by side, swiping dodging, driving back several gators on their own as they perform a dance of arms with their long sharp officer swords, finding gaps in armor and plate. I see other Awes who managed to bring with them or procure spears having formed a phallanx to hold off a large portion of the gator crew and keep our flank safe. </p>

<p> I let out a bellow of my own, which is more of a squeal compared to the guttural growls of the gator warriors, and hop in to join the fray. </p>

<p> I stick my sword in a Gryph who has hopped down from the masts to flank a few of my Awes. I help direct the efforts towards gaps in the fighting or where we are hard-pressed. Its becomming quickly apperent though that this is an unwinnable battle. Maybe if we had the hard shock-troops of our Raptorians, but those are still left on our ship, the few who remain uninjured from the bombardment anyway. </p>

<p> Just as i finnish that thought, a large lumbering pressence heaves himself onboard. Evok arrives, dripping and wet. He does not bellow or growl or make a sound, he just suddenly pounces in, leaping over Awes and pinning a gator underneath his bulk. He swipes his tail and smacks another to the ground with a crushing blow to their snout. He must have leapt overboard with the rest of us and swum all the way here.</p>

<p> Alas Evok seems to be on his own and while he's a considerable force multiplier on his own, the course of the battle is set unless something drastic changes. </p> 

<p> Thats when i spot it, while looking for weaknesses in the thick enemy ranks to exploit, i see they're guarding something. A large knot of gators surround barrels that stand stacked in a corner not far from the big metallic looking tubes that belched thunder and destruction at us. </p>

<p> I check a fallen gryph and find a vial of liquid fire like the ones they were dropping on our ship earlier. I hurl it over the heads of Awes and Gators alike and it lands with a splash and ignites among the barrels. </p>

<p> There's a shout of anger and fear. Then the spot is suddenly bursting violently with spreading fire. The battle seems to pause as all heads turn to briefly assess this new development. </p>

<p> "Back to the ship!" I shout as loudly as i can. The last of us barely make it off the side of the ship, some might not have. As the enemy ship goes up in a loud explosion of violent flames and pressure. </p>

<p> My head is ringing as i tread water, my wings are wet and heavy. Its hard to stay afloat. The waves toss me about. A set of jaws grab me and fling me onto a surface. I lay draped over the back of a Raptorian, i dont know who. </p>

<p> Somehow, despite all odds. We made it. But at great cost.</p>
</div>

<div class="escape hidden"><strong>Escape</strong>
<p> With our sails going strong we put more and more distance between ourselves and the enemy ship. They gave chase a while, even fired once or twice more, but shot wide and lost a lot of distance doing so. It might have been a last-ditch apptempt to cripple us. </p>

<p> In theory they could have paced us and kept on our tail, but by sundown they turned around and headed toward east again. It was both a relief and a worrying turn of events. This ship is not working alone out here, could be they expect us to run into his friends while they cover our escape </p>

<p> We've learned a lot already about the West-sea and what plagues it. But even if the Sea of fangs not been blocked by the annual tide i would still have continued course westward. We have other objectives and i have a strong suspicion the Awe-fleet is going to need any help it can get. </p>
