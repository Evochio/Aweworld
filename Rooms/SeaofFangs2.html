<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<div id="story-text">

<p> Another fluff-shedding night in the sea of fangs has passed. We've been blessed with cloudless skies and the light of the moons to keep the fangs well in sight. I dare not consider braving the pass during poor weather and sight. While the charted route is detailed, I can easily imagine how even briefly getting lost out here would quickly spell doom. </p>

<p> Before the sun had even started to properly light the horizon. A look-out signaled the sign of wreckage in the water.</p>

<p>We have properly arrived at Sea of Fangs now, this is not an uncommon sight around here. But this wreckage was fresh as parts were smouldering in the water.</p>

<p>Whoever this wreckage belonged to had met their demise recently and probably quite violently.</p>

<p>It is unlikely they ran ashore on some reef or one of the smaller craggy cliffs. But larger parts of the wreckage might have washed ashore on one of them.</p>

<p>However, searching all the nearby islands is risky, as its outside the safe and mapped sailing lane and could potentially take us all day and lead us nowhere.</p>
</div>
<hr />

<!--Put buttons to other rooms here. This is an HTML comment btw. -->
<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-1"> Search </button>
<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-2"> Move on </button>
<button class="btn btn-default hidden" id="button-3"> Keep Searching </button>
<button class="btn btn-default hidden" id="button-4"> Abandon Search, too risky! </button>
<button class="btn btn-default hidden" id="button-5"> Continue </button>

<div class="search hidden"><p><strong>Search</strong></p>
<p>I order a search and plot a new course which will take us past the larger and most likely nearby larger cliffs that might have caught the wreckage.</p>

<p>I&#39;d send up my scouts, but i&#39;d be more likely to end up searching and rescuing them instead if i did. The winds are too hard out here, with sudden dangerous up and down drafts which might toss them far out of range of the ship or worse, into the water where the sea-wolves lurk.</p>

<p>The search is perilous and on several occasions the lookouts up in the mast shout out warnings for course changes to avoid collisions with treacherous reefs. I have map-readers note everything down for future referances, if we&#39;re braving these dangers we might aswell make the best of it.</p>

<p>The wreckage in the water increase, we are close.</p>

<p>A loud thud, creak and long scrape has the whole crew cringing all of a sudden. We&#39;ve brushed against one of the reefs. I immediately order crew to check for major damage but its quickly apparent there are no major leaks.</p>

<p>I clench my jaw. The ship is fast and sturdy. Im glad for the later. But at this moment i wish we were on my old smaller and maneuverable &#39;Barristan&#39;.</p><hr />
</div>

<div class="search2 hidden"><p><strong>Keep searching</strong></p>
<p>One of the Raptorians are up on deck, curious at the commotion. He scented the air and suddenly announced. &quot;I smell smoke&quot;.</p>

<p>I directed us upwind and it wasn&#39;t long before I smelled it too. Then I saw the slight smoke rising from behind one of the pointy craggy cliffs that well made this sea worth its name.</p>

<p>A broken up blackened half of a ship lay crashed against the pointy cliffs. In a day or two and most of it would be smashed to pieces by the waves. I approached the ship carefully and had a pair of of my best scouts zip on over.</p>

<p>They searched the ship carefully but not for very long before they hurried on back over. One of them nearly didnt make it and managed to only barely cling to side of our ship, wings quickly having made wet by a sudden spray.</p>

<p>They reported the ship abandoned and empty. No traces of living nor dead. The broken-up hold below had no traces of cargo either. The ship had taken massive damage, they reported deep gouges and even holes that looked to have gone straight through the hull. The fire and wrecking damage has come afterwards. The only thing they found were a piece of rope which they brought over.</p>

<p>The rope confirmed my suspicions. It was Wulf-make. This was definitely a Wulf-ship. But which ship? There was no way to make out any markings on the scorched remains.</p>

<p>On our return towards the charted sailing lanes, there&#39;s another ominous scrape along the whole length of the hull. I cursed and peered into the water behind the ship. The reef had been impossible to spot, it was like a dagger sticking out of the dark depths just under the surface.</p>

<p>A wet Lieutenant Nyxie came up from the holds to report leaks, but again we were fortunate of no outright breach. They are going to be able to plug the leaks, but the ship has taken a beating. I hope the information we gathered will come of use. Most of it was perplexing and worrying.</p>
</div>

<div class="moveon hidden"><p><strong>Move on</strong></p>
<p>I order us to stay on course. Searching the islands here are fruitless. We cannot send scouts into the air this far out to sea because of the winds and wet squalls are too dangerous. Rescue in these currents doubly so. That means we&#39;d have to sail by island after island and expose us to the dangers of running ashore ourselves.</p>

<p>After sailing for a few more hours there are no further traces of wreckage.</p>

<p>The dangers ahead will only grow.</p>
</div>

<div class="moveon2 hidden"><p><strong>Abandon Search, too risky!</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s no telling where the next reef will be, the crew were unnerved enough as it is! I could see them stiff and nervous, gazing down at the foreboding waves, dreading the cold embrace of the sea and the appetites of stalking sea-wolves.</p>

<p>I order us around and back on course. We did our duty to the best of our ability, but getting wrecked here will help nobody.</p>

<p>We make it back to the charted sailing lane safely and without further incident. One day someone will have to properly chart and map every reef and rock in this place, I do not envy them the task.</p>
