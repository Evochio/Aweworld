<h1>The Sea of Fangs</h1>
</div>
<div id="story-text">

<p> Another fluff-shedding night in the sea of fangs has passed. We've been blessed with cloudless skies and the light of the moons to keep the fangs well in sight. I dare not consider braving the pass during poor weather and sight. While the charted route is detailed, I can easily imagine how even briefly getting lost out here would quickly spell doom. </p>

<p> Before the sun had even started to properly light the horizon. A look-out signaled the sign of wreckage in the water.</p>

<p>We have properly arrived at Sea of Fangs now, this is not an uncommon sight around here. But this wreckage was fresh as parts were smouldering in the water.</p>

<p>Whoever this wreckage belonged to had met their demise recently and probably quite violently.</p>

<p>It is unlikely they ran ashore on some reef or one of the smaller craggy cliffs. But larger parts of the wreckage might have washed ashore on one of them.</p>

<p>However, searching all the nearby islands is risky, as its outside the safe and mapped sailing lane and could potentially take us all day and lead us nowhere.</p>

</div>
<div class="search hidden"><p><strong>Search</strong></p>
<p>I order a search and plot a new course which will take us past the larger and most likely cliffs that might have caught the wreckage.</p>

<p>I&#39;d send up my scouts, but i&#39;d be more likely to end up searching and rescuing them instead if i did. The winds are too hard out here, with sudden dangerous up and down drafts which might toss them far out of range of the ship or worse, into the water where the sea-wolves lurk.</p>

<p>The search is perilous and on several occasions the lookouts up in the mast shout out warnings for course changes to avoid collisions with treacherous reefs. I have map-readers note everything down for future referances, if we&#39;re braving these dangers we might aswell make the best of it.</p>

<p>The wreckage in the water increase, we are close.</p>

<p>A loud thud, creak and long scrape has the whole crew cringing all of a sudden. We&#39;ve brushed against one of the reefs. I immediately order crew to check for major damage but its quickly apparent there are no major leaks.</p>

<p>I clench my jaw. The ship is fast and sturdy. Im glad for the later. But at this moment i wish we were on my old smaller and maneuverable &#39;Barristan&#39;.</p><hr />
</div>

<div class="search2 hidden"><p><strong>Keep searching</strong></p>
<p>One of the Raptorians are up on deck, curious at the commotion. He scented the air and suddenly announced. &quot;I smell smoke&quot;.</p>

<p>I directed us upwind and it wasn&#39;t long before I smelled it too. Then I saw the slight smoke rising from behind one of the pointy craggy cliffs that well made this sea worth its name.</p>

<p> Cliffs and reefs are thick here however. We cant safely move ahead without significant risk to the ship. I could however send the scouts by wing out to investigate, but i have to be wary of when i use them, they're irreplacable. Or we could deploy one of our smaller boats to row on over. </p>

<p> My reclusive black-furred scout-master Sixt now stands beside me. I want his oppinion first.</p>

<p> "Aye Captain, we are ready whenever you need us. We can fly there no problem. Getting back can be a bit harder however if we cant take off somewhere high enough." He speaks in a low soft voice. The other two scouts, distinguishable by their heavy cloaks, linger nearby. </p>
</div>

<div class="scout hidden"><p><strong>Scouts</strong></p>
<p>The scouts shed their protective heavy cloaks and climb the masts to fly over from a high position as possible. Their wings are large and well-groomed and take them effortlessly to the broken ship. </p> 

<p>They searched the ship carefully but not for very long before they hurried on back over. One of them nearly didnt make it and managed to only barely cling to side of our ship, wings quickly having made wet by a sudden spray.</p>

<p>They reported the ship, a broken up blackened half of a ship lay crashed against the pointy cliffs. In a day or two and most of it would be smashed to pieces by the waves. No traces of living nor dead. The broken-up hold below had no traces of cargo either. The ship had taken massive damage, they reported deep gouges and even holes that looked to have gone straight through the hull. The fire and wrecking damage has come afterwards. The only thing they found were a piece of rope which they brought over.</p>

<p>The rope confirmed my suspicions. It was Wulf-make. This was definitely a Wulf-ship. But which ship? There had been no way to make out any markings on the scorched remains.</p>

<p>On our return towards the charted sailing lanes, there&#39;s another ominous scrape along the whole length of the hull. I cursed and peered into the water behind the ship. The reef had been impossible to spot, it was like a dagger sticking out of the dark depths just under the surface.</p>

<p>A wet Officer Tick came up from the holds to report leaks, but again we were fortunate of no outright breach. They are going to be able to plug the leaks, but the ship has taken a beating. I hope the information we gathered will come of use. Most of it was perplexing and worrying.</p>

</div>
<div class="boat hidden"><p><strong>Boat</strong></p>
<p> Boat seems the most prudent choice. The winds around these cliffs are unpredictable and tricky even for our gifted scouts. </p>

<p> I ordered the boat lowered and assembled. The hull of it is safely secured against the rear of the ship, to save space and protect it from wear, its components are kept apart and safely in storage. </p>

<p> This is a task drilled into the crew countless time during training i can tell. The boat is quickly finnished and ready, bobbing in the waves next to our ship. </p>

<p> Now the only question is who to send out there to investigate. Everything is made extra risky out in the fangs, the operation needs a officer to lead it. </p>

<p> An arms officer, the first-mate or the captain herself are the standard selection for something like this. </p>
</div>

<div class="boat2 hidden"><p><strong>Boat</strong></p>

<p> The boat bobs uncertainly before they start rowing away.
<span class="tung hidden">Tung, took out his frustration on the 5 crewmembers he picked to join him on this venture. Shouting them into order and proper rowing form.</span>
<span class="arn hidden">Arn had not looked pleased at my selection. He seemed about to object when he thought better of it, perhaps he did not wish to seem a coward. </span>
<span class="garsch hidden">Officer Garsch sprung into action immidiatly. There was no hesitation in that Awe, i liked that. </span>
 </p>
<p> They rowed for a while, while we watched. They were half-way in their approach to the cliff when one of them started jesticulating franticaly. Suddenly the boat jolted, as if they hit a rock. </p>

<p> With what looked like panic they turned the boat around and rowed back toward the ship in a great rush. 
<span class="tung hidden">Tung is shouting but his words are carried away by the wind. Suddenly something knocks the boat nearly onto the side. Awes cling to what they can but some spill into the water. Crew gasp around me. Its the seawolves!</span>
<span class="arn hidden">Arn is pointing and giving directions, his movements are rushed, i've never quite seen him so animated. He peers concerned over the side, having procured a spear they brought along and jabs with it into the water. The boat jostles again as Arn apperently struck something, the jolt sends one Awe reeling and splashing into the cold sea. I suddenly realize whats happening, Sea-wolves! </span>
<span class="garsch hidden">Garsch is encouraging them to row faster, setting a steady pace for them to focus on. But suddenly something knocks into the boat, nearly tipping it over. Its a miracle no one falls in, Garsch has grabbed one of the Awes by the tail and yanks them back. Its the Sea-wolves! </span>
</p>
<p> I quickly order ropes readied. They might have to be pulled back onboard in a rush. Scout Civi is quick to react and grabs the end of a rope and flaps her way out there to meet them. </p>

<div class="tung hidden"> <p> But before she reaches the boat it suddenly capsized in a spray of water as the black shape of a giant Sea-wolf crashes up from underneath with great force. Awes go flying into the cold sea, some trying desperatly to gain air before being dragged down by gravity. </p>
<p> There is little anyone can do. Scout Civi circles back when she reaches the wreckage, dropping her rope. A shape launches from the water to try to catch her out of the air, A smaller seawolf, the white patches on its side clearly visible. But Civi is agile and pulls a daring manouver few Awes could replicate.</p>

<p> By the time the water calms, none of the Awes who were on the boat are visible. Hungry jaws have snatched them and gulped them down. The mood on the ship is grim as we watch for any signs of anyone escaping the Sea-wolves appetite. But none stir. </p>
</div>
<div class="both hidden">
<p> The boat rushes back in a hurry and the Officer manages to get them back safely, but not without a few more jolting bumps and thumps that cause the boat to jump in the water. <p>

<p> With the help of the rope they're pulled in quickly for the last bit of the journey and all brought aboard, panting and looking poofed up in fright. But safe </p>
</div>
<span class="arn hidden"> Arn curses loudly, last to leave the boat. He throws a oar across the deck and kicks over a barrel. He lost a crewmember out there, im surprised to see him cares so much. I leave him be.</span>

<span class="garsch hidden">Officer Garsch managed to get everyone back safely. Though he did not look it i could tell he was unnerved as i commended him and gave him a pat on the back. He'd be drowning himself in spirits later, i made a mental note to have Officer Mirr give him a shift off.</span>
<p> We abandon any further apptempt to reach the wreckage. Its secrets are left to be washed away with the tides. </p>

<p>On our return towards the charted sailing lanes, there&#39;s another ominous scrape along the whole length of the hull. I cursed and peered into the water behind the ship. The reef had been impossible to spot, it was like a dagger sticking out of the dark depths just under the surface.</p>

<p>A wet Officer Tick came up from the holds to report leaks, but again we were fortunate of no outright breach. They are going to be able to plug the leaks, but the ship has taken a beating. I hope the information we gathered will come of use. Most of it was perplexing and worrying.</p>

</div>

<div class="boat3 hidden"><p><strong>Boat</strong></p>
<p> No one was exactly eager to volunteer and I have a feeling I still have a lot to proove to this crew. I was to lead this little expedition myself! </p>

<p> The cadets fret over me, Ziggy looks like she wants to come. But they are still under training and junior officers at best, no point putting them at risk </p>

<p> We row forward with good pace, I keep a lookout myself for any unexpected rocks or reefs. The seas are a bit choppy but if there's one good thing about the fangs its that the waves never get particularly high here on a normal day. </p> 

<p> I see no rocks in the water. But there is a pecular white spot under in the water almost right under the boat. With a start I realize its the eye-patch of a Sea-wolf looking up at me. </p>

</div>

<div class="boat3a hidden"><p><strong>Boat</strong></p>
<p> I try not to startle my rowing Awes too much. But something in my tone seems to alert them nevertheless as i ask them to turn the boat around and return to the ship </p>

<p> Not soon after a huge thud impacts the boat from underneath, nearly capsizing the vessel. I grab ahold of a ledge and hold on and so do the others. </p>

<p> "Row!" I command and help a panicking Awe back into her seat and our boat is soon speeding back toward the ship. </p>

<p> "Brace!" I notice a black shape rushing up toward the boat. The boat rocks once more, spinning sideways and creaking omniously from the impact. Everyone manages to stay onboard</p>

<p> By now the crew on the ship have reacted and I spy a scout flying out to meet us with a rope in her paws, to help pull us in quicker. </p>

<p> With my paws free i manage to grab the rope and hold on as we're pulled in fast and get close enough to clamber onboard. We made it! </p>

<p> There is little to be said. Most breathe a sigh of relief. Ziggy looks glad she didnt press the issue about volunteering, i've never seen the unflappable young awe so tense. </p> 

<p>We make it back to the charted sailing lane safely and without further incident. One day someone will have to properly chart and map every reef and rock in this place, I do not envy them the task.</p>
</div>
<div class="boat3b hidden"><p><strong>Boat</strong></p>
<p> I grab a spear thats resting at the bottom of the boat. A standard complement that im now grateful someone thought to include! </p>

<p> The boat suddenly thuds and shudders, bouncing upwards as something impacts into it. My rowing Awes are caught by surprise and yelp, barely managing to hold on, one of them splash into the water. I nearly fall in myself! </p>

<p> "Help!" Shouts the hapless crewmate before she is suddenly raised out of the water, trapped down to her waist in the jaws of a Sea-wolf, a huge one! The jaws open, gulp and the Awe slides out of sight, swallowed whole. </p>

<p> I cry out and lunge with the spear, managing to score a deep gash across its eye. It squeaks loudly in pain and sinks back into the water. </p>

<p> "Row us back!" I shout. But with one Awe down and the others in panic its slow going. </p>

<p> I keep a look out for black shapes in the water, spear at the ready. But the next one comes from straight underneath. It shatters the boat and sends us all sprawling into the water. </p>

<p> I manage to surface and gasp, i see one of my scouts in the air, dropping a rope, a lifeline. My fur is quickly wet and making me heavy and sluggish in the water. Around my fellow Awes in the water yelp and gasp as black shapes and large dorsal phins sweet past and snatch them away. </p>

<p> Im nearly at the rope as something comes up right ahead of me, toothy pink maw wide open. When did i drop my spear? The jaws engulph me, a thick tongue squezzes against me and force me down a tight passage. </p> 

<p> 'GLUK', the passage constricts, nearly crushing me. I end up plummiting into the depths of the beast. A dark and somewhat spaceous chamber that smells of fish soon holds me. Crawling around briefly does nothing but sate panic and frustration. </p>

<p> Im alone in the belly of the large seabeast. My rowers do not join me, that might mean they got rescued or that the other 2 Sea-wolves got them. I punch and kick at a wall, hoping to be unappetizing. It seems to have the opposite effect as i hear a crooning noise i could have sworn sounds pleased.</p>

<p> There will be no rescue for this former Captain of the Admirality. I will only end up as a cautionary tale, attached to the legend of the Sea-wolfs.</p>
</div>


<div class="moveon hidden"><p><strong>Move on</strong></p>
<p>I order us to stay on course. Searching the islands here are fruitless. We cannot send scouts into the air this far out to sea because of the winds and wet squalls are too dangerous. Rescue in these currents doubly so. That means we&#39;d have to sail by island after island and expose us to the dangers of running ashore ourselves.</p>

<p>After sailing for a few more hours there are no further traces of wreckage.</p>

<p>The dangers ahead will only grow.</p>
</div>

<div class="moveon2 hidden"><p><strong>Abandon Search, too risky!</strong></p>
<p>There&#39;s no telling where the next reef or peril will be, the crew were unnerved enough as it is! I could see them stiff and nervous, gazing down at the foreboding waves, dreading the cold embrace of the sea and the appetites of stalking sea-wolves.</p>

<p>I order us around and back on course. We did our duty to the best of our ability, but getting wrecked here or needlessly risking the crew will help nobody.</p>

<p>It takes the rest of the day to untangle ourselves from the maze of jagged white cliffs we call "Fangs", but we make it back to the charted sailing lane safely and without further incident. One day someone will have to properly chart and map every reef and rock in this place, I do not envy them the task.</p>
