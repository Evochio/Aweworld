<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Wreckage</p>

<p>Early in the morning, before the sun had even started to properly light the horizon. A look-out signaled the sign of wreckage in the water.</p>

<p>We have properly arrived at Sea of Fangs now, this is not an uncommon sight around here. But this wreckage was fresh as parts were ominously smoldering in the water.</p>

<p>Whoever this wreckage belonged to had met their demise recently and probably quite violently.</p>

<p>It is unlikely they ran ashore on some reef or one of the smaller craggy islands. They cannot be honestly called islands though, most are mere jagged jutting cliffs poking out of the sea. But larger parts of the wreckage might have washed ashore on one of them.</p>

<p>However, searching all the nearby islands is risky, as its outside the safe and mapped sailing lane and could potentially take us all day and lead us nowhere.</p>
