<p>The game started. In many ways it was a offshoot of the very common Wulf card game where you received two random cards, bet based on their value and then everyone match their two cards up against a open set of 5 cards on the table. Best combination wins.</p>

<p>But in this variation, called "The Flock" the two cards you get per round is all you get. Your betting currency is fixed to 6 chips. The Matron, of which you get one chip (worth 10 points), 2 Awe Chips (5 points) and 3 Male chips (3 points). Over 4 rounds you bet minimum of one of your chips blind against the others bets, you can only use your own starting chips. The Matron chip is special, which if you decide to pitch it always counts as first bet and done openly. The other players have to then either match it, in a challenge, with their own Matron chip and hope to win with higher value of cards or be forced to ceede a Awe chip. If you do not have a Awe chip, you must match with your own Matron or you are bust and have to give all your winnings over. After the fourth round, the one holding the biggest pool of Chip bets of another player win whatever was at stake in this game.</p>

<p>For example, if Keeper was so confident in his cards he bet his Matron chip in round one. Ziggy challenges him with her own 10 pointer and wins, getting his Matron and the Awe cards from the other players, playing it safe. </p>

<p>The final crux is that betting a male chip can only win you a male chip in return.</p>

<p>The open stakes on the table were:</p>

<p>Depending on which team is the winner, Forbidden or resumed unhindered gambling for 10 points</p>

<p>And wether to have restrictions or not on high-stakes for positive team points.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I was glad I had Ziggy by my side. I glanced toward her and it seemed she had something on her mind, her brow furrowed. I&#39;d rarely seen her with a serious face on, but it seemed she was in her element now.</p>

<p>I glanced around the table quickly before lifting my cards while the others checked theirs. Arn looked stony-faced, but then again he always did. Keeper was stiffling a hiccup or belch of sorts while he looked over his cards with one brow furrowed.</p>

<p>Ziggy had a blank serious face on, betraying nothing. One I wished she&#39;d use more during our weekly debriefings.</p>

<p>I find myself staring at my two cards. I must confess that im not as familiar with this variant of "The Flock" as I thought I were. Usually there values attached to the cards, these merely have the little figures. I've recieved a pair of half-moons.</p>

<p> They should be of decent value. Oh well, I'll manage. This game is probably mostly about bluffing anyway. </p>
</div>

<div class="round1-10 hidden"> <p><strong>Round 1 bet: Matron! 10 points</strong></p>

<p>I announced my Matron bet and it immediately raised heads on the table. Apparently a round 1 Matron bet was very bold or stupid.</p>

<p>The others considered their hands for a moment before placing their own bet cards. No one challenged my Matron with one of their own.</p>

<p>As result I reaped a Awe chip from all three, but its the two from Arn and Keeper that count. Im already at 10 points! I just have to keep my lead.</p>

<p>I notice Ziggy subtly trying to get my attention </p>
</div>

<div class="round1-5 hidden"> <p><strong>Round 1 bet: Awe 5 points</strong></p>
<p>Everyone put down their chips and then turned their play cards.</p>

<p>I had the winning hand. So I reaped the Chips on the table into my win-pile.</p>

<p>I got a male from Arn and an Awe chip from Ziggy and Keeper. A decent win, Ziggys Awe chip was denied from Arn and Keeper atleast. She must have noticed my glance as the cadet gives me a wink and then turns her eyes back to Keepers cards intently.</p>


</div>
 
 <div class="round1-3 hidden"> <p><strong>Round 1 bet: Male 3 points</strong></p>

<p>Everyone put down their chips and then turned their play cards.</p>

<p>I had the winning hand. So I reaped the bets on the table into my win-pile.</p>

<p>I got a male from Arn and Keeper and an Awe chip from Ziggy. The Awe cant be won with a male card so it goes back in Ziggys hand. Overall a low win.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ziggy keeps her straight face on. She must have noticed my glance as the cadet gives me a wink and then turns her eyes back to Keepers cards intently.</p>

</div>
 

 <div class="round2 hidden"> <p><strong>The Game - Ship rules - Round 2</strong></p>
<p>The dealer distributes a new set of card for everyone. I glance around again, but this time they seem to be staring back, I catch both Arns and Keepers eyes as they had been trying to catch a hint of my reaction to my cards.</p>

<p>I &#39;Hmph&#39; quietly to myself and raise my cards to have a look. A very poor hand. A Tail and a coin.</p>

<p>I look back to catch them glancing at their own cards. One of Arns big brows are twitching. Keeper rights himself in his chair with a sigh, heaving his big gut up slightly. He looks like he wants to take a long nap.</p>

<p>I can bluff and be bold or play it safe. </p>
</div>
<div class="round2-10 hidden"> <p><strong>Round 2 bet: Matron! 10 points</strong></p>
<p>I play it bold, poor hand or not I can bluff.</p>

<p>I announce my Matron bet and Arn immediately counters with his own Matron.</p>

<p>Arn has a bigger hand and wins, taking my 10 pointer.</p>

<p>Under the table I get a quick kick from Ziggy. It makes me jolt and I give her a glare. Whether that was for loosing such a big hand or something or not following her plan, im not sure.</p>
</div>
<div class="round2-5 hidden"> <p><strong>Round 2 bet: Awe 5 points</strong></p>
<p>I feel confident and play a Awe chip.</p>

<p>Arn has the larger hand and reaps the betting pool. No winnings.</p>

<p>Ziggy gives a little sigh, perhaps dissapointed I didnt play along. Keeper and Arn are looking non-chalant. It feels like something is occuring right under my nose.</p>

<div class="round3 hidden"> <p><strong>The game - Ship rules - Round 3</strong></p>
<p>The dealer distributes the cards and this time I picked them up quickly, eager to see their worth.</p>

<p>I have a pretty good hand. Two gold coins.</p>

<p>Before I can decide what to bet Arn announces he&#39;s playing his Matron, looking pretty confident. Its beyond me wether he's bluffing it or not.</p>

<p>I have to decide wether to challenge or give up an Awe chip. </p>


</div>
<div class="round3-bet hidden"> <p><strong>Round 3 bet: Challenge</strong></p>
<p>I challenge Arns hand and slam down enough bet to match him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, he turns out to have a double star and I loose the challenge and loose 10 points. Arn chuckles triumphantly and gives me a nod as he collects the bets. This is not good, I do not have many chips left.</p>
</div>

<div class="round3-betzig hidden"> <p><strong>Round 3 bet: Challenge</strong></p>
<p>I challenge Arns hand and slam down enough bet to match him.&nbsp;. Ziggy is quick to follow suit, grinning wickedly. Keeper cant stay idle, with so many points at stake, he also throws his bet into the mix, making all players invested.</p>

<p>Ziggy ends up the winner with two Home cards, cackling as she gathers the bets, somehow im not surprised. But Keeper and Arn both look positively perplexed by the sudden twist.</p>
</div>

<div class="round3-nobet hidden"> <p><strong>Round 3 bet: Do not challenge. Give high card</strong></p>
<p>Arn reaps an Awe chip from all players and chuckles grimly, no one choosing to challenge him. Things were looking up for their team.</p>

</div>

<div class="round3-nobetzig hidden"> <p><strong>Round 3 bet: Do not challenge. Give high card</strong></p>
<p>Ziggy challenges him with a cocky grin, but looks surprised when you do not follow suit! She blinks and looks confused for a moment, fumbling with her paws, this messes with her plans </p>

<p> Keeper who's been near slumbering the whole time also puts down his matron in challenge. He appears to have the highest value and reaps the bets, looking coy. </p>

<p>I was starting to wonder if this game was such a good idea.</p>

<div class="conclusion hidden"> <p><strong>The Game - Ship rules - Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Our winnings were not enough. Our combined score was negative 10 points and thus the games continue unhindered.</p>

<p> Im slightly surprised by how short the game is, but I find out there's normaly 2 more runs of 4 rounds in standard rules. We just ran a quick one. Perhaps Arn and Keeper had hoped for a swift victory and they got it. </p>

<p>This was a blow to my authority. I had let myself get carried away and fallen for their little plot to skirt my commands. In hindsight it might have seemed like a slightly foolish decisions. Especially as I just learned Ships rules means High-stakes. Had I lost with too many points, who knows what they could have demanded.</p>

<p>I suppose I could decide to stop it anyway, despite how spiteful it would seem to be. But this whole thing had left a sour taste in my mouth.</p>
</div>
<div class="conclusion2 hidden"> <p><strong>The Game - Ship rules - Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Arn and Keeper won with a slight advantage in score. </p>

<p> Im slightly surprised by how short the game is, but I find out there's normaly 2 more runs of 4 rounds in standard rules. We just ran a quick one. Perhaps Arn and Keeper had hoped for a swift victory and they got it. </p>

<p> As it is, the games will be continuing. High-stakes are still allowed, if all players consent, but no one in high debt may any longer be tempted into wiping their debts with high risk plays. Its the compromise I was atleast able to reach </p>

<p> Its far from perfect, there are still those of the crew deep in debt. Atleast I've earned some slight grudging respect for tackling an issue on equal terms. </p>

</div>
<div class="conclusion3 hidden"> <p><strong>The Game - Ship rules - Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Well well well. Ship Rules.&quot; Announces Keeper smugly. The room is silent and Ziggy trembles in her seat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;You are below the double lowest negative score agreed upon Captain. Arn being the winner in this high-stakes game thus wins the right to devour you.&quot; The wulf chuckled softly.</p>

<p>&quot;I did not agree to this!&quot; I protested, rising out of my chair violently. But I could already see it was a lost cause. I had no allies in here except maybe Ziggy, the rest were all Arns closest gang. I realized now that this is how the last captain must have perished, stepped on too many toes in the wrong places. To think such mutinous behavior existed, all for some gambling!</p>

<p> "Well, perhaps you should have paid better attention"

<p>They rushed me, tackled me from all sides. The struggle was brief, I dont even manage to utter a shout before my snout is tied up. Ziggy too is pinned to the floor, a hissing muffled fury of an Awe.</p>

</div>

<div class="conclusion4 hidden"> <p><strong>The Game - Ship rules - Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Ziggy wins the game and she cackles loudly and triumphantly while Keeper and Arn look entirerly stumped with the results, they seemed very surprised at the loss which makes me suspect their were not playing entirely fair. That makes me also wonder about Ziggys results, but at least victory was ours.</p>

<p>&quot;Well well well! Double negative, for all of yas! My my myyyyy&quot; Ziggy raises her shirt to rub her fuzzly belly around suggestively. I raised my eyebrow at this.</p>

<p>&quot;By Ship rules, that means I get some officer-grade meat dont it?&quot; She turned her head to me with a smirk. &quot;You look puzzled, didnt I tell ya? Ship rules means high-stakes, by doubling their lowest score, iiiii win the right to eat them!&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I dont think I had ever seen a smugger Cadet then Ziggy at that moment.</p>

<p>&quot;You brat, dont you think I know you switched out your cards somehow!&quot; Arn suddenly barked.</p>

<p>&quot;Awwww! Is the big guy upset? Like you were any better, you can cryyyy all about it in my cabin tonight! Mmmh, both of ya!&quot;</p>

<p>Arn growled and cracked the knuckles of his paws, muttering darkly. &quot;Oh I&#39;ll feed ya something...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aaahahahaah!&quot; Ziggy just cackled in his face, completely unfazed.</p>

<p>This was getting out of hand.</p>

<p> "No one is eating anybody. As we won, that practise is now strictly forbidden." I remind Ziggy before she gets in a brawl with my First-officer. </p>

<p> Ziggy looks stunned and goes silent for a moment before she clutches and tugs at her ears </p>

<p> "Ah reekin fluff-biters! I forgot!" She growls. </p>

<p> Arn merely shakes his head at her, but he looks relieved. Their words trouble me though. I only now realize we've been playing a quick round of high-stakes Flock, thats what Ship-rules mean. </p>

<p> Furthermore, it seems they've been cheating, almost openly. I've just been too thick to realize it. Without Ziggys help, things could have turned bad indeed. </p>

<p> In anycase, its dealt with now. </p>
</div>
<div class="conclusion5 hidden"> <p><strong>The Game - Ship rules - Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> We won with a slight positive team score. Not enough to forbid the games, but enough to forbid high-stakes and stop its drain on valuable crew. Debts have also been wiped and may no longer be allowed to be held, a slight controversy but to the benefit of most.</p>

<p> Im slightly surprised by how short the game is, but I find out there's normaly 2 more runs of 4 rounds in standard rules. We just ran a quick one. Perhaps Arn and Keeper had hoped for a swift victory. </p>

<p> "Well played captain, you play a clever hand." Arn manages a compliment. He might be sore from loosing, but he does not seem so peturbed. 

<p> "Thank you Arn. Remember our deal. I dont want to hear of any more attrition caused by debts." I try to sound firm, Arn merely nods. </p>

<p> The crew respects the way you handled the issue and skillful play. Im only now starting to realize we've been playing a quick round of high-stakes Flock, thats what Ship-rules mean.</p>

<p> Furthermore, it seems some form of cheating was near acceptable, I just did not notice it. Im glad I was lucky. Or perhaps Ziggy did something to tip the odds, I'll not know. </p>
</div>

<div class="conclusion6 hidden"> <p><strong>The Game - Ship rules - Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Its a solid victory! With a positive 10 points, the game "Flock" is henceforth forbidden to be played and the racket with all debts are wiped. While the crew is allowed their small games of chance, no debts or high-stakes may be held. </p>

<p> Im slightly surprised by how short the game is, but I find out there's normaly 2 more runs of 4 rounds in standard rules. We just ran a quick one. Perhaps Arn and Keeper had hoped for a swift victory. </p>

<p> I cant help but grin at the sore looking face of Arn. He and Keeper exchange glances, the Wulf seems to shrug, he got the most out of the game while it lasted. I have a feeling he wont challenge the issue any longer, not as sure about Arn. </p>

<p> "Well played Captain." The first-officer mutters and gives me a nod and turns a icy glare at Ziggy. </p>

<p> "Thank you Arn. Remember our deal, I played it your way, so honor it and dont make me regret it!" I add a firm snap to the sentence. </p>

<p> With what looks like reluctance the officer salutes and I leave the room. Hopefully this whole issue is now settled. The crew will hopefuly talk favorably about how the issue was handled.</p>

<p>  Im only now starting to realize we've been playing a quick round of high-stakes Flock, thats what Ship-rules mean.</p>

<p> Furthermore, it seems some form of cheating was near acceptable, I just did not notice it. Im glad I was very lucky. Or perhaps Ziggy did something to tip the odds, I'll not know.  </p>
</div>

<div class="ziggyplan hidden"> <p><strong>The Game - Ship rules - Round 2  Ziggys plan</strong></p>
<p> Im not sure what she's up too. But I choose to trust her and as the dealer deals out the cards, sliding them over the table, I lean in too far and accidentaly swipe my two cards to the floor with a "whoops" </p>

<p> Everyone at the table looks at me suspiciously, im not a good actor. Arn especialy fixes both me and Ziggy with a hard glare. But as I hadent even looked at the cards yet, what choice do they have then to redraw cards for everyone. </p>

<p> Ziggy seems to shrug and smirk.</p>

<p> "Happens too the best of us Cap!" </p>

<p> It is time to place bets. My cards are 'Home' a picture of a mountain and a tail card. I cant for the fluff of me remember the value of the home card, it was either very high or low. I should have learned the rules better. </p>
</div>

<div class="except hidden"> <p><strong>Except...</strong></p>
<p>“Except...”</p>

<p>The room seems to freeze, it might have been the tone of my voice.</p>

<p>“Its not quite fair to let Ziggy go unrewarded.”</p>

<p>The young cadets eyes seem to light up like suns.</p>

<p>“She did win the high-stakes game itself.” I continue with a slight grin.</p>

<p>“Yer twisting the rules!” Arn objects loudly. </p>

<p>“They were twisted up already, to my disadvantage to boot!” I snap angrily, towering up. To his credit he does not shrink away. “Do you think im too daft to realize?!“</p>

<p>The room is silent. No one dares speak. </p>

<p>“You've tried to get rid of me. Perhaps it is how you got rid of the last captain. We may never know. For now, im inclined to let Ziggy have you.”</p>

<p>The giddy cadet squirmed on her feet, but wisely remained silent. It probably took her colossal effort. </p>

<p>“Well, have anything to say?”</p>

<p>Arn says nothing. He averts his eyes though. Guilty. I wonder what made him like this, once he must have done well to become First-officer. But he never was mine.</p>

<p>Still, perhaps it was enough to give him this one scare to put him straight. They all waited for my judgment.</p>
</div>

<div class="dismissed hidden"> <p><strong>"Dismissed"</strong></p>

<p>I dismiss them all. Arn seems to let out a deep breath he'd been holding. Ziggy shuffles out too, disappointed, but she does not object. I feel slightly guilty for getting her hopes up. </p>

<p>Arn might remain a problem. I'll have to keep a close eye out for dissent. But hopefully this was the last time he troubles me.</p>
</div>

<div class="toziggy hidden"> <p><strong>Report to Ziggys quarters</strong></p>

<p>The whole room seems stunned. Only Ziggy lets out a smirking chuckle. </p>

<p>“Come along, oh First-officer. You and me are gonna get close.” She mocks harshly. I've half a mind to tell her to be respectful, but let her be her flavor of sass. It'd be both a reward for her help and fitting punishment for Un-Aweish behavior by the former first-officer. </p>

<p>Arn looks glum. If there's fight in him, he isnt showing it. To be sure he does not do anything unwarranted, I summon Mid-officer Garsch to watch him and Ziggy. </p>

<p>  The rumor spreads fast in the ship, I hear whispers and catch glances as the news of Arns defeat and the manner of it becomes known. To my surprise, most seem to snicker about it. There is something deeply ironic about his fate, like it reached a pivotal end that he had set himself up for. Whatever underlying loyalty I feared he'd held seemed to be absent. So even though I've just fed my first-officer to my trainee officer-cadet, its not an agitated buzz I sense, but one of curious amusement.  I find myself unable to resist a grin as I make my way back to the main deck to oversee our course and speed. </p>
