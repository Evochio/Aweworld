<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>I sent the cadets out to scout me the time and place for when i could catch Arn red-handed. It did not take long.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I burst into one of the commons with the slam of cabin door behind me. I was pleased to see Arn, Keeper and 3 other Awes cringe at the sight of me. To their credit, they kept their composure pretty well and calmly put down their cards and got up for a salute. Keeper sported a sizable sagging gut, I judged he had eaten perhaps 2 days ago. That Wulf had downed two Raptorians of this crew now, one more and he&#39;d stand for 10% of their attrition alone.</p>

<p>But it was not with him i had a bone to pick. It was Arn who had overturned my orders without my permission, it was his eyes on which my gaze fell.</p>

<p>&quot;At ease. You have some explaining to do.&quot; I announced coolly, arms crossed. A part of me wanted to eat everyone in the room and im sure they must have felt that. They shrunk away from me and parted away from Arn ever so subtly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Crew matters are a responsibility of the First-officer.&quot; Arn started, seeming collected and able to meet my gaze, remaining relaxed. &quot;I allowed the games again due to morale issues.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh i see! Morale issues.&quot; I began to pace slowly. &quot;And when were you planning to let me know of these morale issues?&quot;</p>

<p>The others stood and looked quite uncomfortable at this confrontation. Doing this infront of part of the crew was a risk, if this didnt go well, the word would spread quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;I did not see it necessary to report captain, as the issue was minor enough and solved easily and quickly.&quot; He responded.</p>

<p>&quot;By reversing my direct orders! Resulting in further attrition of a valuable resource!&quot; I passed by Keeper and gave his belly a bap with my paw, it wobbled faintly. Arn spoke up more passionately.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand, its unfortunate. But with respect, I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you that attrition like this is normal. Especially among Raptorians. I&#39;d venture to say we&#39;ve had quite a placid bunch of Raptorians, usually there is more trouble from them amongst each other...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which we have to commend the great leadership of Packmaster Evok for.&quot; I interrupted. &quot;There&#39;s no reason to rile them up!&quot; I leaned forward to gaze into his eyes, gage his resolve in this. &quot;Fact still remains.. i ordered a lid on the games. I can interpret these actions as you going behind my back and disobeyed these orders. Why should i not eat you here and now and move to end your little gambling racket before you&#39;ve even started to properly digest?&quot;</p>

<p>Arn picked his words carefully then, i could see the gears turning in his head, afterall, what he said next would determine the closeness of our future relationship.</p>

<p>&quot;It would be in your right, ofcourse, to do this. But as your First-officer i strongly recommend against such action, it might quickly prove to be an unhealthy choice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you mayhaps poisonous Arn?&quot; I chided.</p>

<p>&quot;No, not at all, no doubt im little of an obstacle for the mettle of a Vice-Admirals stomach.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it the &quot;morale issues&quot; again?&quot; I picked up some cards from the table, looking them over.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes Captain. The games have become a familiar pass time for this crew, it was played long before your time on this ship and our late captain turned a blind eye too it. The mix of chance and skill mean anyone can pick up and play it and the risks involved are what make it all the more exciting. Sailors will always gamble, no matter what the high admiralty back in port judges. The game gives them an outlet for that with universally agreed upon rules so there&#39;s no grudges and bickering. Is that not reasonable?&quot;</p>

<p>While Arn talked, it struck me that i didn&#39;t hear about the resumed play of this game until the Cadets reported it. None of the crew had stepped up to report the infraction. It meant most of them were on Arns side in this. Still, i could not back down from this now this far into it.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not agree with these &quot;Risks&quot;.&quot; I replied. &quot;Attrition is an recorded accepted loss, yes, but encouraging it with this kind of gambling can only lead to trouble. Especially if it antagonizes the Raptorians!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one has forced the Raptorians to play. They&#39;re not bad gamblers, some have just taken too steep risks and paid for it. Besides, have you even tried the game, you&#39;d see its quite fair if you did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Its not about whether its fair or not, i have to minimize the &#39;risks&#39; to the crew so we have the highest likelihood of success on our journey, this is not a pleasure cruise!&quot; I snapped.</p>

<p>&quot;Its in your right to command the games stopped once and for all, of course. Or charge us to no longer allow high-stakes that lead to loss of crew. But im telling you now, the crew will feel it unfair.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I gazed over the others present in the room then. They had stood mute and still through this confrontation. They felt my eyes over them and stiffened. I adressed one of the Awes at the end of the line. A private Oran if i was not mistaken.</p>

<p>&quot;And would you private? Feel it unfair of me to follow through with these orders?&quot;</p>

<p>The private was nervous and took a moment to swallow before speaking, her mouth probably dry.</p>

<p>&quot;Between work shift and sleep shift there often are not a lot to do, captain. There are only so many times gear and floors can be polished without getting worn down from it. The tournaments are fun and some personal bets exciting&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I felt a slight pang of guilt then. These were honest words coming out of the privates mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of personal bets might those be private?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh.. you know...&quot; She blushed. &quot;Personal favors, shift changes, Eat or be eaten...&quot;</p>

<p>Keeper spoke up then to add some input and a bold suggestion.</p>

<p>&quot;High-stakes gambling with permanent results are not so common, most have sense to know when to fold. Look, Captain. Why not play us for it in a game. If you win, we&#39;ll back down or do whatever you command. The crew would welcome and accept any results of that.&quot;</p>

<p>Keeper was a Wulf true to his kins wily ways. Issuing a challenge like that. Things had reached their conclusion. They now waited my decision. Would i stay the course and forbid the games or perhaps i&#39;d teach them all a lesson in their own turf. Its suited me to play ignorant of this game and its rules so far.</p>
