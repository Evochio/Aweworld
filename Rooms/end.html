<h1>End Chapter 1</h1>

<div id="story-text">
<p>
    A shrill squeak from the crow-nest up in the mast announce that land has been spotted. The first island of the grand archipelago called thousand islands
    are in sight. Truth be told the amount of isles in this sea surpass that amount, but if you counted the ones that were more then sandbanks and had trees
    and what could be considered livable conditions you might get around that number.
</p>
<p>
    Such an island approached us now. If my navigation was true, we should be arriving at our first rallying point, where the fleet who went ahead of us first
    arrived. Its not the outermost island, that would have been too obvious, but close enough.
</p>
<p>
    As we sail nearer we spot no signs of other ships in the area. The fleet is not here. I start to consider if they might have left some message as to where
    their whereabouts and call the scouts in preparation. Otherwise we'd be forced to sail from one designated fleet navigation point to another until we find
    them. Nothing else to do while the Sea of Fangs are blocked off by dangerous low tide.
</p>
<p>
    Another squeak from above, one that warns of incoming has me and the rest of the crew pause and peer about. A lone figure is flying toward us from the
    island. Judging by the silhouette and wing form, a Awe is approaching.
</p>
<p>
    “That's one of ours.” Says my scoutmaster, having appeared by my side. “Whats the fool doing flying such a distance! He should have waited for us to get
    closer to the island, he's risking himself.”
</p>
<p>
    The answer soon arrives with the 'Fool' Scout. A black Raven-eye like my scoutmaster. He manages to land nimbly enough and is brought before me. He's
    exhausted and panting, his wings quivering from exertion. My scoutmaster and him exchange a nod of familiarity.
</p>
<p>
    “Captain! Are you the vanguard of reinforcements!?” He asks between breaths. “This location is not safe! They watch this place, they will be coming!”
</p>
<p>
    “Slow down, who is watching? Its just us.” I reply sternly, feeling confused.
</p>
<p>
    “Just you?” The scout shakes his head. “The pirates, they have a fleet too and weapons like we never seen! The Admiral has refused full retreat, it would
    mean leaving the slowest ships behind. But they are being hounded and whittled down. She has sent for reinforcements but if you're the only one who's come,
    then the birds are not making it through!”
</p>
<p>
    There is another call from the crow-nest above. Ships spotted! Some have been hiding behind the island.
</p>
<p>
    I grit my teeth and sigh deeply. From one tangle to another, the West-sea never failed to live up to its reputation.
</p>
<p>
    “FULL SAILS! Lets find our fleet.”
</p>
