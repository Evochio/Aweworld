<h1>Pale-Rock meeting</h1>
</div>
<div id="side" class="hidden">

</div>
<div id="story-text">
<p>We arrive at the western point of Pale-rock. Impressive jagged cliffs decorated the end of the windswept cold island. </p>

<p>Southeast from here lay the Wulf lands. It is strange to consider how close our nations lay to each other. But besides the somewhat calm east-sea the routes are long, roundabout and ever fraught with perils. </p>

<p>This is the rendezvous, alas we are quite behind schedule! They should be here waiting for us. We spend the day sailing around Pale-rock close to the south side without seeing the trace of anybody. </p>

<p>I start, with quite some frustration, realize we must have missed our window for the meeting. We are days late, but i'd hoped they would value our cooperation and try to stick around and wait longer. </p>

<p>I suppose there is also the chance something spooked or drove them off. But... Despite my colored opinion of Wulfs, I am forced to admit it would take a lot to scare off a Wulf ship with a purpose. </p>

<p><br />
</p>
<div class="hidden" id="Keeper">

<p>Speaking of Wulfs. Keeper has arrived on deck to spy the horizon, mostly for show. He approaches me and I already know what he is going to say, so I cut him off before he finishes his first word. </p>

<p>“Yes, it appears we have missed our window.” I grunt. “Too many unforeseen delays. Perhaps we were even given too little time to begin with.” The excuse sits poorly in my mouth, I do not believe in it despite my own words. Its cheap to blame unfair circumstance. </p>

<p>Keeper nods, he sees my annoyance and offers a placating gesture.</p>

<p>“Perhaps indeed. In the end it was not even certain the Intel itself was critical to the mission. The only thing my sources would reveal that I was a lot of roundabout information and guesswork. Such things may lead one astray too!” He smiled and looked curiously relieved. An old instinct from my time in the East urges me to find out why and what he's hiding. But I decide not to press the issue, he is a crew-member despite his other affiliations, not a smuggler. </p>


</div>
<p>I make us wait around until sundown and then head out further westward and first light. </p>

<p>We still have to find the rest of our fleet, who no doubt will be at the archipelago sea, or Thousand Islands as its called here in the west. Though how we're expected to find them in that chaotic cluster of islands im still unsure of. We only have a few navigation and rallying points to head toward. </p>
