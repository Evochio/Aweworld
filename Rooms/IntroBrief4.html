<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p><strong>-&rdquo;What happened to the captain?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Grand Admiral began to pace behind her desk, a paw suggestively on her ample belly. &ldquo;I wont go into too much detail, I believe the less you know the better. So no more questions about that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll reveal he did not gel well with the crew. There had been problems even before this journey. He lacked... Leadership.</p>

<p>A Captain stands above her crew, she is the authority of the ship. But if a captain does not have the respect of the crew then she has authority over none. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The grand admirals pacing brought her to a halt and she turned to face you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good leadership is hard to come by! Most Awes would rather follow then lead. And among those who desire to lead, the traits of selfishness and greed are often dominant. Such leaders lack the vision for the greater good of all. That&#39;s why the Admiralty and the Academy was created. We find, nurture and grow those potential few among us who are capable. Those who are <em>just</em> and those who would put a foot down and deal with trouble before it grows.&rdquo;</p>
