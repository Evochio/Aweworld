<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>

<div id="story-text">
<div class="arn hidden">
<p>They come in the night, sneaking and whispering. Its hard to be prepared, when the majority of a crew rise up against you.</p>

<p> In an organized fashion they sneak in and catch you in your sleep, giving you no chance to react to such an intrusion. </p>

<p> Gagged and bound up, you briefly glance Arn giving the orders. He spares you nothing but a disdainfull sideways glance. No matter your anger or rage at the situation or at him, none of it will help you.</p>

<p> Its a mutiny, the first-officer has moved against you in reaction to your decisions and general growing discontent in the crew. </p>

<p> "Are the others taken care of?" He murrmurred to a low-officer. </p>

<p> "She took care of them." The officer replied. </p>

<p> Before you can dread the implications of that, attention is directed toward you. Arn steps forward, brows furrowed. </p>

<p> "Sorry Avolc. You stepped on too many tails. The Admirality might think the captain is the sole authority. But in the end, a ship is its crew. And we must all bend our will to the will of the many." </p>

<p> If that was an apology meant to placate you, you're not given long to think about it. They do not doom you to the sea. Instead the wide-open jaws of a Raptorian suddenly greet your view. </p>

<p> What better way to make a captain dissapear then the wide large belly of a large reptile like that. You are wolfed down with ease and abandoned to your thoughts in the dark cramped stomach. Until the churning and rumbling belly overtakes you. </p>
</div>
<div class="noarn hidden">
<p>They come in the night, sneaking and whispering. Its hard to be prepared, when the majority of a crew rise up against you.</p>

<p>Its a sudden crash as the door flies open and they come rushing into the captains quarters, weapons, ropes and nets at the ready in a chaotic rush.</p>

<p>Im on my feet, drawing my saber from its scabard beside the bed, but im overwhelmed in moments.</p>

<p>I wonder briefly what came of my cadets, they are at least nowhere in sight in the crowd that overwhelm me.</p>

<p>It was a battle they&#39;d claim, after having limped back to port once more with the ship in bad need of repair. A hard battle against superior numbers. The captain fought bravely, but she did not make it. But her sacrifice allowed for the rest of the crew to make a break for it and flee.</p>

<p>They&#39;d falsely praise her memory and make up tales to cover their deed. Maybe the next captain would be better. Maybe this one would understand how they wanted things to be run and not put its nose where it didnt belong!</p>

<p>Otherwise they would draw the lots again, see what lucky sailor got the honor of a grand captains feast.</p>

<p> They're unorganized and leaderless but driven by discontent. Perhaps the loss of Arn was what did it, with no one around to temper their mood. </p>

<p>It was the agile quiet lookout that won Avolc. Drew his lucky lot and did a little wordless jig. Up in the masts the politics and ongoings of the holds below mattered little to him. But he&#39;d certainly not say no to a plump refined officer-awe filling him up.</p>
