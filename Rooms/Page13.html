<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>Day 16</p>

<p>Bad storm on the horizon, it lays straight in our path. We could try to sail around it, but that could take many extra days. The crew is still fresh and the ship is in top shape so we could also chance going through it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to see what this ship can do. But i have to keep the overall objective in mind.</p>

<hr />

<!--Put buttons to other rooms here. This is an HTML comment btw. -->
<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-1">Batten down the hatches, we are going through</button>
<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-2">Better play is safe, lets skirt around and avoid the worst of it</button>
