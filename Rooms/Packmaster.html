<p>We are on the more open seas of the Bay of spines, having finally lost sight of the mountainous west-coast. Wind is brisk and the weather has cleared, we have a good pace again, quickly making up for lost time.<br />
Ship morale seems stable, my cadets report the crew mostly staying out of trouble. What little there's been, the Officers have been able to keep a lid on without escalating to me at least. <br />
A large Core part of this crew has sailed together for nearly a year on this ship already, but the crew has nearly doubled in size for this journey with a mix of new recruits and older reserves. It pays to keep a close attention to it this early on. </p>

<p>I got a chance to talk to Packmaster Evok of the Raptorians today. It seems the Raptorians, most of the time, keep to themselves on this ship, lightly tended by the Squires they trust. But that is hardly a surprise or anything uniquely new, they tend to prefer it that way and it is not because of any particular animosity toward Awes.<br />
They are picked and then trained for being obedient and placid. Admiralty learned early that having the strongest and most aggressive Raptorian fighters caused more trouble then they made up for in increased fighting strength. Thats not to say that these Raptorians would not be ferocious fighters when its their due to fight.<br />
Still, trained or not, it pays to make sure they are content and comfortable. You do not want 35 upset or bored Raptorians starting to consider change in diet and to make sport out of the rest of the crew. A few hundred of us in these tight confines are almost no match and we'd all soon find ourselves closely tied to Raptorian physiology. <br />
In any case, Packmaster Evok, big brute of a Raptorian, seems reliable and smart. He will let me know if anything is amiss. He was surprisingly quite taken to Cadet Ziggy, who i worried had been bothering them with her sometimes raucous merrymaking.<br />
