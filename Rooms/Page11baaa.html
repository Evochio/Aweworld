<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>&quot;Oh please Avolc, im having so much fun! Lets have one more game, i&#39;ll never meet an admiral like you!&quot; Melon whined, tugging at Avolcs arm while looking up with large admiring eyes, partially covered by the oversized hat.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh...&quot; the hardened admiral buckles.&nbsp; &quot;Just one more, but then we&#39;ll have to see you back to your father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then i want to be the admiral and you be a cadet!&quot; Little Melon exclaimed enthusiastically and grinned.</p>

<p>With slight hesitation and then a slight smile, Avolc adjusted her captains hat on Melons head. It was much too big for her, but now&nbsp;out of her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha! Im the admiral now!&quot; Melon quickly found her role. &quot;Stand to Cadet!&quot;</p>

<p>Avolc obediently stiffened and stood at attention in front of the diminutive little commander.</p>

<p>&quot;Turn left!&quot; The little admiral commanded and Avolc turned left. &quot;Turn right!&quot; She ordered and it was obeyed.</p>

<p>Now giddy with her newfound power, Melon thought hard on how best to make the most fun out of such an opportunity.&nbsp; Why not use them for the greatest privilege of all! The ability to dispense of punishment.</p>

<p>&quot;Not quick enough! Drop down and give me 10!&quot; The harsh commander giggled with an increasingly gleeful grin as Avolc drops down begins her pushups.</p>

<p>&quot;Not quick enough!&quot; Was her evaluation, her pitched little voice now getting used to the commanding tone, why she has natural talent. &quot;Attention!&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Somewhat tiring from these quick demanding orders, Avolc slowly rises to attention. She seems to have awakened a little monster. The lax attitude is quickly picked up by the attentive little commander and she shakes her head disapprovingly making a &quot;tsk tsk&quot; sound.</p>

<p>&quot;Not good! Not good at all!&quot; Admiral Melon paces backwards and forwards infront of her poor Cadet. &quot;We cant have slow and disobedient cadets! You are probably one of those thieves from today! You are now a prisoner!&quot; The young commander is quick to produce a little piece of twine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Hands behind your back!&quot; Avolc sighed obeyed and soon found her paws surprisingly tightly tied by a sailors-knot behind her back.</p>

<p>&quot;What does the prisoner have to say for herself?&quot; Melon demanded. &quot;Guilty or not guilty?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guilty&quot; Avolc grimly admitted in her best dastardly voice.</p>

<p>Melon gasped. &quot;Guilty! Im afraid i must eat you then.&quot; She nodded, passing judgment and dropping her hat over her face while she patted at her petite tummy.</p>

<p>Avolc gave the little Admiral a frown and a coy tilt of her head. &quot;Effective immediately?&quot; she asked, amused.</p>

<p>&quot;Immediately!&quot; Melon exclaimed, adjusting her hat out of her face so she can see. And is surprised to see the larger Awe crouched ahead of her so they&#39;re on the same level. She blinks uncertain.</p>

<p>&quot;Better get too it then Admiral!&quot; Avolc smirks. Giving the youngling a bit more then she asked for would be a good way to teach her not to overreach and perhaps make her tire of the game. &quot;Or is an admirals word not law?&quot;</p>

<p>Young Melon is not one to loose a challenge, nor give up such an opportunity! With a wide yawn she engulphs the snout of the larger awe and hooks her arms under Avolcs armpits. A mighty swallow and shifting of head from side to side ensures the head of her would be disobedient cadet slides over her tongue and actually pops right into her gullet. Cheecks bulging now the young admiral coos in delight at the turn of this game, she braces forward and spreads her jaws further, cramming the shoulders into her maw aswell. She&#39;ll devour this malcontent and show her!</p>

<p>Avolc meanwhile, with her head squished in dark tight drool-filled gullet was immediately starting to regret playing this game. Things were starting to get a bit humiliating and she might have humored the young girl a tad too much. As another series of steady gulps and swallows rippled along her head, neck and chest she had to remind herself that this was but a game. She&#39;d not loose her nerve and loose any more face by begging Melon to stop, let her get to her limit, which she&#39;s surely at and then help her recover from aching jaw.</p>

<p>But Melon would have none of that, she&#39;s had few opportunities to test her limits, besides with large fish, which this certainly wasent but it was going down all the same. She was also stubborn and sore looser and would have none of that, Admirals rule was law, she&#39;d banish Avolc to her belly and win the game.</p>

<p>And so she did, using every bit of stubbornness and flexible Awe anatomy to her advantage, the youngling swallowed up Admiral, demoted to Cadet, down to her waist. By then Avolcs head was well inside the gut of the young Awe and having lost her nerve kicked feebly and flopped with her body. Her muffled shouts lost from under layers of flesh and fur and drowned out by heavy labored gulps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Melon felt every bit of relief as she finally only had the adult Awes legs left to swallow, no longer strained and feeling like her jaws were about to pop, she heaves herself back wards, pulling the massive weight gathering in her belly along with her to sit. The large kicking hindpaws go down like any wiggly large fish she&#39;s eaten and she gulps them all the same.</p>

<p>Its not until the last of the tail of her meal is about to vanish into her lips, that large poofy tailtuft of a female awe; that she starts to come out of her feeding haze and the utter impact and weight of her actions, not to speak of the bloated feeling of fullness from her belly comes over her.</p>

<p>Avolc meanwhile can hardly believe it, or comprehend the mental fact that she&#39;s just been devoured whole and alive, cape and all, by Melon. She can barely move her body, laying curled up tight in the uncomfortably packed stomach of the young little awe. Her arms are still tied, she cant even properly speak, perhaps from shock.</p>

<p>Melon groans, uncomfortable and slightly confused. This was the first time she&#39;d fully experienced the haze, that mechanism which helps an Awe devour large prey with full focus and without distraction. Groggily she rubs over her wiggling large gut, trying to remember what she was doing just before. She&#39;d been playing a game. It seemed so distant and unimportant now. She swallows the last of that tail and moans, stretching to get comfortable and adjust that huge meal tight against her body so it feels right.</p>

<p>Exhaustion claims her and she passes out in automatic food-coma, her muscles and body had worked hard, adjusted and shifted to accommodate such a huge meal. She will need all her energies now to deal with food in her stomach. She does not hear Avolcs muffled questioning moans from within her, she does not hear the slight knock on the door from an inquiring cadet who&#39;s there to remind them of dinner. She far from needs any more dinner anyway.&nbsp; She luckily does not hear as she digests her beloved idol alive.</p>

<p>With no response from the knock, the cadet leaves, figuring the Admiral has already departed for dinner with her young little charge. They&#39;re somewhere lost in the hustle and bustle of repair work and people moving everywhere.</p>
