<p>A day passes uneventfully, as most days tend to do on a ship. There is a certain rhythm that settles at sea thats no different no matter what sea you are on. Everyone eventually finds their routine and I've come to settle into mine. </p>

<p>After a light breakfast, usually carried to my quarters by one of my attentive cadets, my door is open to anyone who wishes to see me. Usually its Nyxie to confirm and update me on course and heading from the night. <br />
This morning I find Garsch waiting quietly and patiently to have a word.</p>

<p>“Captain!” A precise salute and straightened back greets me as Arms Officer Garsch greets me.</p>

<p>“Officer, what can I do for you?” I inquire curiously. I had often seen Garsch about the deck, maintaining order and performing disciplinary actions on crew who earned his ire. </p>

<p>“I have a concern and a proposition for you.” Garsch maintained his rigged at-attention position. </p>

<p>“Speak. And do relax.” I suggest politely. There's too much riggid drill-instructor in this old officer sometimes, not that I really considered it a flaw. Garsch relaxed his posture and continued. </p>

<p>“I notice a lot of idle paws around the ship, some who manage to get away with little hard work at all. Such kind of laxity will draw Awes to temptation and complacency. I am concerned of our preparedness for possible incidents will deteriorate severely over time.” </p>

<p>“We have more crew aboard then there are possible duties to perform. What do you suggest Officer Garsch?” I ask, genuinely curious. </p>

<p>“We Drill once a week, but perhaps we can arrange for a more frequent schedule. Bi-daily practice for anyone without tasks for either martial exercises, fire drills, sail maintenance. This would keep the crew on their feet and sharp.”</p>

<p>“Have you brought this up with Arn?” Suggestions like this should normally come from him. </p>

<p>“Yes. But he thought that it would cause too much discontent among the crew and that we'd risk overworking and exhausting them for when it really does count.”</p>

<p>“Since you've come directly to me, you do not agree.” I smile faintly. </p>

<p>“No Captain. While he is probably right about it not raising morale, I believe as an Admiralty ship its our duty to be at the best we can be. That is all.” Garsch seemed to relax further, now that he's said his peace.</p>

<p>“You've given me something to think about Officer.” I nodded in dismissal and Garsch marched off, as informal as ever. If I permitted this, I had no doubt he would drive the crew hard. But he was certainly not the kind of officer who cared about being unpopular.</p>

<p>I saw no downsides to being more prepared. Truth be told, I had noticed the crew not being quite the well-groomed and expedient machine I wished them to be. Too much free- time put them in trouble, like with the gambling incident from the other day. </p>

<p>They might grumble, but I soon had written orders ready for Garsch to arrange a schedule for increased drills every 3 days. I was not completely without mercy.<br />
There will be a lot of running up and down the deck and masts for the crew ahead.</p>

<div class="nodrills hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>While Garsches concerns are valid. I do not quite share the opinion that some free time will have too much deteriorating effect upon crew efficiency. <br />
A well-rested and happy crew may perform just as well as a thoroughly whipped one. </p>

<p>Its not like the weekly drill is not hard enough.</p>
