<p>&quot;Very well. I&#39;ll play your game and we&#39;ll see what happens.&quot; I sighed and crossed my arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was no fool, I knew this was what they wanted. This way they had several chances of winning me over. Either by me seeing the &#39;fun&#39; of this game, or them physically winning the rights from me to continue their gambling.</p>

<p>I ofcourse had no real obligation to follow any results of this game. But once committed, what kind of captain would I be if I went back on my word.</p>

<p>Arn was pleased. He quickly got us setup at a table with cards at the ready.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright captain. An ideal game is for four players. To make things fair and represent our respective agendas, why dont you pick a player partner up with you.&quot;</p>

<p>I didnt even have to look around, Ziggy who had been hovering close by was immediately at my side.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me do this &#39;cap!&quot;</p>

<p>I nodded, she was as good as any. The cadets were the only allies I could truly trust anyway.</p>

<p>By the time we were all seated, a minor audience had gathered. They tried to be subtle and out of the way, but none could hide their curiosity.</p>

<p>At the table was me, Arn, Ziggy and Keeper with his prominent and occasionally quietly gworbling gut. Raptorians evidently took a long time to process, even for Wulfs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ll be playing Ships rules then.&quot; Arn announced. This got a nod from Keeper and a glance and shrug from Ziggy.</p>

<p> As no one seemed to have objections I agreed too </p>
