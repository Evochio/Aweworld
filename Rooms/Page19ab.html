<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>One of the Raptorians are up on deck, curious at the commotion. He scented the air and suddenly announced. &quot;I smell fire&quot;.</p>

<p>I directed us upwind and it wasn&#39;t long before i smelled it too. Then i saw the slight smoke rising from behind one of the pointy craggy cliffs that well made this sea worth its name.</p>

<p>A broken up blackened half of a ship lay crashed against the pointy cliffs. It&#39;d only be a day or two and most of it would be smashed to pieces by the waves. I approached the ship carefully and had a pair of of my best flyers zip on over.</p>

<p>They searched the ship carefully but not for very long before they hurried on back over. One of them nearly didnt make it and managed to only barely cling to side of our ship, wings quickly having made wet by a sudden spray.</p>

<p>They reported the ship abandoned and empty. No traces of living nor dead. The broken up hold below had no traces of cargo either. The ship had taken massive damage, they reported deep gouges and even holes that looked to have gone straight through the hull. The fire and damage wrecking has come afterwards. The only thing they found were a piece of rope which they brought over.</p>

<p>The rope confirmed my suspicions. It was Wulf-make. This was definitely a Wulf-ship. But which ship? There was no way to make out any markings on the scorched remains.</p>

<p>On our return towards the charted sailing lanes, there&#39;s another ominous scrape along the whole length of the hull. I cursed and peered into the water behind the ship. The reef had been impossible to spot, it was like a dagger sticking out of the dark depths just under the surface.</p>

<p>A wet Lieutenant Nyxie came up from the holds to report leaks, but again we were fortunate of no outright breach. They are going to be able to plug the leaks, but the ship has taken a beating. I hope the information we gathered will come of use. Most of it was deeply worrying.</p>
