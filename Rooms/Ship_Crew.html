<h1>The Ship & Crew</h1>
<hr />
<div id="story-text">
<p>
    The meeting with the crew went well, they were unsurprisingly as curious about me as I were with them. It was all mostly formality and ceremony, we'd have
    plenty of time to get to know each-other in the days to come.
</p>
<p>
    This is a larger crew then I ever commanded, its one thing to see the numbers and another to have everyone lined up before you. I had hoped for a bigger
    ship and crew when I returned to Tranquil, I just didn't think I'd be standing before one barely weeks later.
</p>
<p>
    The diversity of the crew surprised me too. There were Awes of all tones, taken from all over the lands. Even the Raptorians didnt appear to be all from the
    same Clan. These were no laborer Raptorians either, they were clearly warriors and stood with a discipline under the watchful gaze of their Alpha.
</p>
<p>
    Besides them stood a contingent of squires, dedicated Raptorian caretakers and armorers.
</p>
<p>
    They had even assigned me 3 valuable Scouts. Awes with high flight-aptitude and rigorous training to make the best use of it. The three of them stood,
    unsurprisingly males all, by themselves off to the side, heavy cloaks covering and protecting their large wings. The leader was a black-furred Raveneye, with eerie yellow eyes that
    seemed to pierce straight through you when he looked your way.
</p>
<p>
    At the front, with her two assistant nurses stood the Pouch-Matron. The medic and health caretaker of the crew. Her eyes were softer and she smiled with a
    peaceful soothing softness that spoke well of ability already.
</p>
<p>
    The bulk majority of the rest of the crew, the able sailors, fighters and workers all in one. They looked experienced all, fray-furred wings and manes from
    long times at sea.
</p>
<p>
    They had spared no expense for this crew. I was starting to realize more and more how the East-Sea was little but a training-ground for the inexperienced.
</p>
<p>
    One mysterious cowled figure stood by herself to the side of them all. My manifest said nothing about this individual and the crew appeared to give her
    wide berth. Perhaps more would be revealed in the officer-meeting.

<div class="officers hidden"><p><strong>Officers</strong></p>

<p>The officers gathered in the spacious planning room attached to the captains cabin. </p>

<p>They were a motley bunch of characters, 9 all in all. </p>

<p>Arn, my new first-officer, a gruff looking fellow with large brows that gave him a perpetual frown and a more salt-frayed mane then most, made the introductions. I sensed a coldness from him and he was all business in our first meeting. Time would have to tell how well he'd serve. </p>

<p>Keeper, Logistic-officer. A groomed looking Domestic Wulf with spectacles nodded politely in my direction. He had an orderly and respectable look to him, but I've seen a lot of Wulfs in my day and I knew a mischievous one when I saw one. </p>

<p>Evok, Packmaster. As a Raptorian he took up most of the space of room with his presence. But he was the least animated of them all though, slow and deliberate in his movements. Anything more and he might have broken a wall. </p>

<p>Nyxie, High-officer - Navigation. Nyxie resembled my former First-mate in more then appearance. Attentive eyes and thoughtful demeanor, little seemed to slip past her notice which is an important trait for navigation. </p>

<p>Tick, High-officer - Maintenance. Tick, a small male, looked almost bored and unremarkable, didnt speak once. I wondered at what qualities had seen him promoted to high-officer, no doubt highly qualified in his job. </p>

<p>Tung, Mid-Officer - Arms. Another male, large one too. This one seemed to be wearing a permanent scowl on his face (he'd make quite a pair with Arn), one mostly directed at me. Cant say I liked the look. </p>

<p>Garsch, Mid-Officer – Arms. Sharp, curt and to the point. His first impression was promising. He bore an impressive scar that seemed to split his ear and give his right eye a permanent squint.</p>

<p>Mirr, Mid-officer – Crew. Of all the officers, Mirr seemed the youngest and newest. She had a curious choice in mane-styles and a City-Awe stance to her. She seemed out of place but no doubt she was good at managing crew or she wouldn't be here. </p>

<p>Ulv, Mid-officer – Ballistics. Of all my officers, Ulv looked the most predatory and eager of them all. She was itching to get out to sea. Her eagerness was promising. </p>

<p>There were more officers in the crew, Low-officers all, who took orders directly from the Mid and high officers. For now these were the names and crew i'd mostly interact with directly however. I was sure that by the end of this voyage, i'd know the names of all under me. </p>

</div>

<div class="cowled hidden"><p><strong>Cowled figure</strong></p>
<p>I asked about the cowled figure and Arn grunted, managing to somehow deepen his scowl even further. </p>

<p></p>

<p>“Priestess that one.” He explained and would have left it at that if I hadent kept staring at him. </p>

<p>“Politics or some other have decreed that each crew over a hundred souls must have a spiritual representative. They are civilians and we're stuck with em. At least its just one.”</p>

<p>“I wasent told about this.” I muttered annoyed, to which Arn shrugged. </p>

<p>“Such is them politics 'cap, rumour has it this one went straight over our dear Admirals cap aswell. There are some faithful in the crew I know. As long as they get their poetry nights there wont be trouble.”</p>

<p> There was not much to add to that so i left it be for now. Whatever my objections this was a decision appears to have been made back in the capital. Hopefully it would not become a problem. </p>
</div>

<div class="confrontation hidden"><p><strong>Confrontation</strong></p>
<p>I laid out the plan as given to me by the Grand-Admiral to my officers and showed them our route and intended rendezvous with the Wulf ships. Through the whole briefing Tung gets increasingly complacent and sighs and scoffs quietly at my words to the point where ignoring it further would show that im not in control or afraid. Perhaps what he's after all along. </p>

<p>“Officer Tung!” I eventually snap at him. “Do you have something to add?”</p>

<p>“Why'd they send us another soft-fur from the East is what I wondering!” He began confrontationaly. It takes most at the table aback. </p>

<p>“You question my ability?” I ask acidly, feeling my fur bristle. </p>

<p>“Yeah! Last captain was weak and indecisive. Turned back at the first sign of trouble! You'll be the same, I can tell.”</p>

<p>Arn was starting to clear his throat to diffuse the situation but I raised my paw and silenced him. I was the one had to deal with this. Im not sure what spawned this kind of open hostility and insolence, it was against all Admirality standards of conduct. </p>

<p> Things must have gone seriously out of control on this ship. Despite the Admirals assurances. </p>
</div>

<div class="hard hidden"><p><strong>Hard-line approach</strong></p>

<p>The decision was simple. I could not have my officers questioning me before we were even under way. As a captain I had to prove myself strong and dominant and not as soft as my fur may have made me look. </p>

<p>“Stand down or be downed.” I glowered at him, daring him to question my authority again. </p>

<p>Tung chose to make a mocking huff and cross his arms, sitting back down. But I was taking a hard-line approach today, I did not want the future problems he might make. </p>

<p>“So be it... report to my quarters, you are demoted to rations. The rest of you are dismissed for the time being.”</p>

<p>A rather nonplussed officer cadre hesitated a moment, turned to look at Tung and then filed out of the room. </p>

<p>Tung was heavy, complained loudly but not dumb enough to fight his superior officer, especially while at port. He must have thought i was bluffing up until the moment I swallowed him whole. For Insubordination, contempt and... being hungry. I hadent had a solid meal in my long trip west and have to admit I was cranky. </p>

<p>But truth be told, I recognized Tungs type straight away. They can be solid officers and loyal to a fault, but only if you gain that loyalty to begin with. Otherwise they will find every opportunity to undermine you for their own agendas. </p>

<p>Problem is that they rarely gain that attitude alone, there are deep-rooted problem somewhere in this crew. </p>

<p>For now, this problem is deep in my gut. I called the officers back and resumed the meeting. No one made further remarks and chose to ignore any errant noise. </p>

</div>

<div class="soft hidden"><p><strong>Softer approach</strong></p>
<p>I pinned him to the spot with a hard glare. Undaunted by his direct accusation of incompetence. </p>

<p>“Are you some sort of mystic Officer Tung?” I asked him with hard tone. </p>

<p>He frowned at the question and then shook his head. </p>

<p>“No... but..” He started before I interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Are you perhaps above the Grand-Admiral?” I snapped quicker. </p>

<p>“No, I am...” </p>

<p>“Then don't embarrass yourself further with your insights. Perhaps go take it up with the Grand-Admiral up at the headquarters, I am sure she'd love to hear what you think and can tell about me. Shall I send you up there, we're still in port.”</p>

<p>Officer Tung visibly bit his lip and looked flustered. He was getting no support from the others as his eyes searched around. Arn seemed to shake his head slightly at him. </p>

<p>“No...” He finally spoke in a low voice. “I'll be fine. I spoke out of turn.” </p>

<p>Tung looked subdued, but the air was still thick with tension. He would probably not question me further for now. I had to earn the respect of this crew, I knew this. But I was already off to a rocky start. </p>

<p>The meeting continued without interruption. </p>
</div>

<div class="cadets hidden"><p><strong>Cadets</strong></p>
<p>One more surprise was in store for me in terms of crew. Admiralty have decided to bestow upon me three fresh Officer-cadets, straight out of the Academy. </p>

<p>While the Academy is a tough school who few graduate from, I'd thought they'd send young inexperienced officers to the East-sea to learn. But times have changed rapidly while I was in the east and since i graduated from there, they are training them quickly now to be able to meet the demands of a growing fleet. Officers are hard to come by and leadership takes time to train. </p>

<p>These three cadets, while technically ranked just beneath a low-officer, are directly under my personal command and are supposed to work under me to learn from me. At first I was annoyed at the thought of having young cadets constantly underfoot, but after briefly meeting them, I am not quite as apprehensive. It could prove quite useful to have fresh junior officers under my beck and call. </p>

<p>I will make sure to get further acquainted with them as everyone has settled.</p>

<p>My concern is whether they'll blend in with the crew well, being fresh as they are out of the academy. Im sure they train them on ships there a while, but not the true rigours of deep-sea voyage. </p>
