Day 2

We have set sail. I would have liked to report it was without incident but disciplinary actions were a necessity during roll-call. Lieutenant Tung is hereby listed as deposed and I have personally carried out his sentencing. A bulky fellow, he should be digested by me in about 2 days.

During roll call and line-up of crew Lt.Tung showed contempt to senior officer in what I can only perceive was an effort to undermine authority and test me. Authority and respect is everything and I saw it necessary to carry out punishment immediately.

Though being devoured for not properly standing at attention and snickering at my speech may seem harsh, we are in for a long journey, I am not planning on ending my career in the belly of a ambitious officer or mutineer later down the line. The crew needs to know they are led by a strong capable captain and that im not as soft as I look.

I report the numbers of crew now are 150, a solid number. Before lifting anchor we were joined by 3 young officer cadets right out of the Academy. They will observe and assist, learn about command so they too might receive their own commission someday. I was immediately skeptical to bring such young cabin-fledglings along to the rough Sea of fangs. But their attentive eagerness to serve and fresh loyalty might make them the first allies I have on this ship.  

This is also the first voyage I have been on with an attending chaplain of "The order" along. She came to me after retiring to my cabin and insisted on performing "the last rites of passage" on my meal. It seemed silly to me, but I made no objection, it seemed as good a oppertunity as any to observe their methods and what i had to expect from their stay. The rite only involved a blessing about the meals passage into me and a slight polite rub.

Im doubtful about the new laws of every ship having to have to include a representative of The order. It seems like a waste of space and resources on an already crowded and sparse ship to me. But I suppose its all politics now. There’s no denying the influence of this new faith has grown over the last few years in our society. I can see, having met the chaplain, how they are more often referred to as the “Soft-spoken”, they have a way with words that sets you at ease.

I will keep this journal updated on their usefulness, for ships morale and general order.

I will also make an effort to write down some personnel records. A initial assessment on the cadets will follow.
