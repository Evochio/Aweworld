<p><em>Admirals log. Avolc</em></p>

<p><em>Chillmane Cove</em></p>

<p><em>Day 2</em></p>

<p><em>We have set sail. I would have liked to report it was without incident but disciplinary actions were a necessity during roll-call. Lieutenant Tung is hereby listed as deposed and I have personally carried out his sentencing. A bulky fellow, he should be digested by me in about 2 days.</em></p>

<p><em>During roll call and line-up of crew Lt.Tung showed contempt to senior officer in what I can only perceive was an effort to undermine authority and test me. Authority and respect is everything and I saw it necessary to carry out punishment immediately.</em></p>

<p><em>Though being devoured for not properly standing at attention and snickering at my speech may seem harsh, I immediately recognize the type. We are in for a long journey and I am not planning on ending my career in the belly of a ambitious officer or mutineer later down the line. The crew needs to know they are led by a strong capable captain and that is not as soft as she looks and who will not let herself be stepped upon.</em></p>

<p><em>I report the numbers of crew now are 150, a solid number. Before lifting anchor we were joined by 3 young officer cadets right out of the Academy. They will observe and assist, learn about command so they too might receive their own commission someday. I was immediately sceptical to bring such young cabin-fledglings along to the rough Sea of fangs. But their attentive eagerness to serve and fresh loyalty might make them the first allies I have on this ship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>This is also the first voyage I have been on with an attending chaplain of &quot;The order&quot; along. She came to me after retiring to my cabin and insisted on performing &quot;the last rites of passage&quot; on my meal. It seemed silly to me, but I made no objection, it seemed as good a opportunity as any to observe their methods and what I had to expect from their stay. The rite only involved a blessing about the meals passage into me and a slight polite rub.</em></p>

<p><em>Im doubtful about the new laws of every ship having to have to include a representative of The order. It seems like a waste of space and resources on an already crowded and sparse ship to me. But I suppose its all politics now. There&rsquo;s no denying the influence of this new faith has grown over the last few years in our society. I can see, having met the chaplain, how they are more often referred to as the &ldquo;Soft-spoken&rdquo;, they have a way with words that sets you at ease.</em></p>

<p><em>I will keep this journal updated on their usefulness, for ships morale and <em>general order.</em></em></p>

<p><em>I will also make an effort to write down some personnel records. A initial assessment on the cadets will follow.</em></p>
