<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Captain chose mostly like i would have done if given the choice.</p>

<p>The thief from his crew that our Cadet Valnos caught, he announced during the quick trial would to his catcher.</p>

<p>The cadet looked momentarily stunned.</p>

<p>I realize now he probably had quite a bit of stage-fright, being the type that did not enjoy being put in the spotlight and be overly noticed. He was also under pressure now to accept his reward to&nbsp;devour the thief, he did however not shrink to the task. No one graduates the academy without some experience in this and young Cadet Valnos was very... textbook... in his method.</p>

<p>The merchant crew thief had little discipline and made feeble attempts to make his case but his snout was soon was muffled by&nbsp; Valnoses jaws. All male Awes are pretty small, but Cadet Valnos was smaller then his prey. For a moment it looked like he had some problems subduing the unwilling Thief. But i quickly recognized the good old and practiced academy Cling-shift-gulp method come into play, skillfully performed. His meal went down without even being able to cause any more fuss. The Cadet even managed to stay on his feet through the entire devouring. His old instructors would have been proud.</p>

<p>The other thief, our old crew-mate, he said he&#39;d deal with personally at a later date. It was somewhat irregular but i decided not to make a fuss about it. I had left things to Captains judgment after all.</p>

<p>Repairs were completed later that evening and Captain Russel vigorously shook my paw, glad for our help and service. They would now surely make it to port.</p>

<p>He also reported, after having asked around his crew that some new information did come up regarding that pirate ship.</p>

<p>The firebombs they used were devious and made out of some sort of oil, it was in trying to put out the fire with water that it actually spread the fire further. It was only after it spread that it became a danger taking, if left alone most went out.</p>

<p>I thanked him for the valuable information and we parted ways. Melon waved us off vigorously, she was sporting a very sizable gut and i think i can guess where our former crew-mate ended up. Such is the way of dotting parents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was hard to resist such cheer and many of the crew, including me, waved back; Sure now that they&#39;d make it safely to harbor.</p>
