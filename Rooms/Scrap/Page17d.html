<h1>To bet or not to bet</h1>

<p>I had listened to him plead his case, but i had sensed no remorse in his actions, only excuses. His final act of inviting me to be part of the gambling was the last straw of it. He probably thought he had been successfully convincing&nbsp; as i smiled at him, but that quickly changed as i shook my head and pulled out a piece of paper and placed it on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;I trust you&#39;ll be able to sign this one. It&#39;ll look good on your record if you sign your own waiver.&quot;</p>

<p>Arn looked flabbergasted to say the least. It might not have been the kindest way to deliver the news, just when they had their hopes up.</p>

<p>The first officers duty was to take care and sign all paperwork involving the crew. Each, promotion, demotion or loss in the act of duty had a respective record tied to its action. For most cases a simple scribbled entry into the crew manifest. But for demotions to food, a piece of paper called &quot;The waiver&quot; was involved. It was signed by the demoted or the First officer if that was not possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arn stared at the waiver, a deflated look to him with his shoulders and wings sagging. I chose to say nothing, because nothing needed to be said. I rose from the chair and begab ti unbuckle my belt, it would be getting in the way soon.</p>

<p>&quot;I can sign it for you...&quot;&nbsp; I stated calmly. That got his attention and he almost jumped in his chair. He gave me a look, blinked at my unfastening of the belt, stared at the waiver and then looked around him in the room as if to find salvation.</p>

<p>&quot;But.. C-captain!&quot; He stumbled out of his chair as i approached him. No doubt things were moving too fast for him, but thats the way i preferred it done. Atleast with officers.</p>

<p>The decision to devour the First-mate of the Attentive might be a controversial decision. Usually the First-mate and the captain are who stand closest together on a ship and go down together. As he unagreeable kicked his way down my gullet, i could at least be sure which of us would be going down into who and who&#39;d be doing the standing.</p>

<p>Getting my jaws around his head was not hard, but as he had not agreed with previous issues, he did not much agree on adding himself to my figure. We scuffled for a while, he might even given me a bruise, but a male is as usual no match to the bulk and weight of a female and before long his kicking were fruitless. I tried to keep it quick and formal but as we were alone in his cabin, it was hard to resist not letting himself tire himself out first pedaling at the air. My habit of giving a dominant purr while feeding quieted him down however and the rest of him soon filled my stomach up nice and round.</p>

<p>I signed the waiver of his demotion with his and my name and made my way back.</p>

<p>Im unsure whether the baffled looks i got was because of the angry jostling and unbecoming muffled shouting of Arn or the fact that they were even surprised it came to this. Direct disobedience has its price, we have stern rules in the Admiralty for a good reason.</p>

<p>Still, Arns words gave me some thought. Sailors like to gamble, perhaps there was something in letting them keep their game but with restrictions. At least like this i had demonstrated with high-stakes gambling will lead you too if you start gambling with the rules.</p>

<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-1"> No more games </button>
<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-2"> Restrictions </button>
<button class="btn btn-default hidden" id="button-3"> Continue </button>

<div class="restrictions hidden"><p><strong>Restrictions</strong></p>
<p> I understood this passtime of the crew had become important. </p>

<p> They can keep their game, ban one type of game and another will take its place anyway. But all further gambling with currency and debts are over. Likewise all current standing debts people might have are wiped!</p>

<p>These would be my final words on this! And I made it known i would make sure they&#39;re followed through! I catch any word, hint or sniff of anyone disobeying these restrictions the party responsible would be getting an invitation to visit to the captains quarters to join Arn.</p>
