<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p><strong>-&ldquo;We are working with the Wulf-fleet now?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the Admiraltys dealings and relationship with the Wulf &ldquo;Fleet&rdquo; has been tenuous at best in the East sea. They have never quite seen eye to eye with us, seeing that they are more a mob of cooperating privateers then an organization like us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But of late our diplomatic contacts have, for a price, come to an arrangement with them in regards of the security of the west sea. And we know only that they have asked for one of our ships to meet with theirs. Your Wulf liaison aboard will provide you with more information as you approach Pale rock. Keep him in one piece.&rdquo;</p>
