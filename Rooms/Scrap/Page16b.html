<h1>To bet or not to bet</h1>
<hr />
<<p>Evoc seemed genuinely concerned about this. I dont know if its because he&#39;s deeply in debt himself or if he really thinks the Raptorians will take matters into their own paws eventually, which is a scary thought.</p>

<p>I cant and wont forbid the games but i can put a lid on the dangerous escalation of debts leading to crew members eating one another unnecessarily much.</p>

<p>I take the issue up with Arn and Keeper and they made a pretty speech.</p>

<p>&quot;The games have become a familiar pass time for this crew, it was played long before your time on this ship and our late captain turned a blind eye too it. The mix of chance and skill mean anyone can pick up and play it and the risks involved are what make it all the more exciting. Sailors will always gamble, no matter what the high admiralty back in port judges. The game gives them an outlet for that with universally agreed upon rules so there&#39;s no grudges and bickering. Is that not reasonable?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not agree with these &quot;Risks&quot;. Attrition is normal, yes, but encouraging it with this kind of gambling can only lead to trouble. Especially if it antagonizes the Raptorians!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one has forced the Raptorians to play. They&#39;re not bad gamblers, some have just taken too steep risks and paid for it. Besides, have you even tried the game, you&#39;d see its quite fair if you did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Its not about whether its fair or not, i have to minimize the &#39;risks&#39; to the crew so we have the highest likelihood of success on our journey.&quot; I snapped.</p>

<p>&quot;Its in your right to command the games stopped once and for all, of course. Or charge us to no longer allow high-stakes that lead to loss of crew. But im telling you now, the crew will feel it unfair.&quot; He tapped his foot and then gestured toward a table.</p>

<p>&quot;Play me for it in a game. If you win, we&#39;ll back down or do whatever you command. Thats properly high stakes, is it not? The crew would accept and even welcome that. If anything atleast to try it out before you pass judgment.&quot;</p>
