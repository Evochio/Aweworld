<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>I will admit my stomach has been rumbling for this chance for some time now. The crew has been impeccably mannered and obedient so far and although that incident with Keeper had me considering my options, i cant go and devour Officers for every tiny defiance.</p>

<p>Thieves however!</p>

<p>The law is clear, especially on an Admiralty ship where discipline and orderly conduct is everything. The actions of the crew reflects on its Captain and Admiralty itself thats why infractions like this are dealt with harshly and immediately.</p>

<p>I made no ceremony out of the act, there was work to be done and my appetite was up.</p>

<p>I devoured the thief of the merchant crew first, he was lacking of discipline and was trying to make his case, interrupting the proceedings. Head-first down the gullet, he kicked and moaned all the way down and for a long while still afterwards. I did not note his name and cannot recall it now afterwards. He is also past asking.</p>

<p>The other thief, crew-mate of the Perked ear was a private named Finnik. She at least had backbone and stood straight and silent while she was read her sentencing. Nor did she did not struggle as i made her my meal. As a female this made her plumper form actually take some effort to swallow down. I think i might have purred, i dont quite fully recall, but i did draw a few eyes in my effort to get her down to an already rounded and jostling belly of mine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First-officer Arn rounded up the little trial quickly enough and i retired to my cabin.</p>
