<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p><strong>-&ldquo;Why is the west now so important?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For long the west sea has been closed to us. Wild weather and currents of the cold North sea and a myriad of treacherous shoals in the Sea of fangs have made sailing and exploration more dangerous then we are willing to risk ship and crew.</p>

<p>So most of our trade and contact with the west have lain in the calmer east, with the Wulfs as expensive proxy. Their connection westward in the southern seas are safer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You glance at a elaborate map hanging off the wall in the office. You wonder what point the Admiral wants to make.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But times change and we must change with it or tempt the fate of the old Plains-awes. As you may well know, trade routes westwards have grown substantially over only the last decade. Mapped paths through the sea of fangs, closely guarded by Gryph trade-houses opened the way. These maps have now somehow been revealed for all, suddenly the west is no longer closed to us. Nor others who might exploit it.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
