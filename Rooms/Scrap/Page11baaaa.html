<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>It wasn&#39;t the despair as much as the humiliation over her predicament that got Avolc to stop wriggling and shouting. She could feel walls of the stomach constantly closing in, wishing to adjust her into optimal position for digestion. She fought it at first, slowed her demise in hopes of being found. But the more time passed in the dark and wetly groaning gut of the young awe, the more she hoped it&#39;d be over before they did.</p>

<p>How does one explain away a predicament like this, how does one maintain the respect the position demands. How would they even manage to get her out in the first place without hurting Melon. With a twitch she stopped her useless struggles, swallowed that feeling of helplessness and gave up control.</p>

<p>The young girl slept deeply in her food-coma, propped up against a wall with her legs splayed around her great gut. Avolc felt her body gently tugged closer, as the stomach walls tightened their embrace, she soon lay unable to move an inch tight against Melons young body.</p>

<p>The churning grew from there, as well as the wet soaking feeling of juices building up in her fur, scrubbed against her as they slowly worked to dissolve her. This wasent how she had imagined ending her line of duty. Not quite the peril one expect to fall too, the appetite of young little floofling. In retrospect, Melon did indeed remind her of herself. Perhaps she&#39;s make an even greater admiral one day. She&#39;d certainly have quite some Admiral in her now.</p>

<p>The churning gut picked up pace and speed as process of turning Avolc into Melon got underway. The noise of digestion as the stomach went &#39;Glorg, Blourp and Gurgle&#39; didnt quite bother anyone but Avolc into her final moments. There was something grim about hearing the tune of your own digestion. Time passed, Melon slept peacefully while her body did its work. It was only with a shiver and lick of lip the young awe eventually stirred in her coma&nbsp;but by then&nbsp;the great admiral had succumbed to her young little body.</p>

<p>No one wondered about the whereabouts of Avolc and Melon for that day. Having been seen together so vigorously getting along well together, there was no need for anyone to consider bother them until ship repairs were complete a whole 2 days later.</p>

<p>What they found by then was too far gone to even consider saving. The captain were but&nbsp;soft gurgling chubbiness on a very plumpened young Melon. She had been awake by then and much too ashamed and fearful over what she&#39;d done to call attention to herself. Perhaps her young mind hoped she&#39;d finish digesting the late&nbsp;Admiral to such a degree that she&#39;d get away with it and escape guilt.</p>

<p>No punishment was given to young Melon however, no one could have been convinced she&#39;d ever overpower and devour an admiral out of malice. Whatever happened was an accident or carelessness on Avolcs part.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Admiral Avolcs passing was glossed over in the records, to save the Admiralty face she was&nbsp;reported&nbsp;as &quot;Lost in service&quot;.</p>
