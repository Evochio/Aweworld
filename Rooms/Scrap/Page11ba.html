<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>I was unsure at first on what to do with the request, i&#39;ve yet to have children of my own. But something about Melon reminded me of myself when i was but a wee floof.</p>

<p>Captain Russel was grateful and honored i chose to entertain his daughter and promised he&#39;d let me know if he remembered or found out any more facts about the pirate vessel from his remaining crew.</p>

<p>I spent the evening telling tales and going through admiralty protocol to the attentive little youngling.</p>

<p>I can almost swear the cadets are jealous. Its most amusing.</p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s no end to a younglings play, the next morning she wants to stay in my company and play more.</p>

<p>The cadets and First-officer Arn claim to have things under control.</p>

<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-1"> Entertain the girl</button>
<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-2"> Decline graciously, work to be overseen. </button>
