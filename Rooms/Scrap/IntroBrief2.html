<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p><strong>-&ldquo;New Ship and crew?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know well enough that it would take immense time, effort, cost and risk to sail a ship from the east sea round the south of Wulflands and back up north. It is not an option. Your old ship will be assigned to a new captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it will be a challenge to acquaint yourself with a new ship and a crew you yourself did not pick. This crew has trained together and prepared for the West sea. You are in truth replacing another captain we had originally chosen who turned out to not be quite up to task.&rdquo; The Grand Admiral straightened in her seat and you wonder for a moment extra about her figure. &ldquo;They returned back to port after only 2 weeks at sea. Whats required here is someone with proven qualifications for leadership, leave the sailing to the crew&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for the ship, I think it will impress you. It is of a new hardier design and material, crafted especially for the west sea. Your ship is called &ldquo;Perked ear&rdquo;. You will not have seen its like in the east. It will serve you well.&rdquo;</p>
