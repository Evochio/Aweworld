<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>I will admit my stomach has been rumbling for this chance for some time now. The crew has been impeccably mannered and obedient so far and although that incident with Keeper had me considering my options, i cant go and devour Officers for every tiny defiance.</p>

<p>Thieves however!</p>

<p>The law is clear, especially on an Admiralty ship where discipline and orderly conduct is everything. The actions of the crew reflects on its Captain and Admiralty itself thats why infractions like this are dealt with harshly and immediately. But so should good conduct also be rewarded!</p>

<p>I made little ceremony out of the act, Cadet Valnos received a commendation for his vigilance and i granted him chance to deal with the thief he caught. He looked momentarily stunned. He had probably thought i&#39;d eat them both myself.</p>

<p>I realize now he probably had quite a bit of stage-fright, being the type that did not enjoy being put in the spotlight and be overly noticed. He was also under pressure now to accept his reward devour the thief, he did however not shrink to the task. No one graduates the academy without some experience in this and young Cadet Valnos was very... textbook... in his method.</p>

<p>The merchant crew thief had little discipline and made feeble attempts to make his case but his snout was soon was muffled by&nbsp; Valnoses jaws. All male Awes are pretty small, but Cadet Valnos was smaller then his prey. I should have considered this beforehand, but i also realize now i might also have unduly put him in risk of embarrassment if he could not get the thief down. For a moment it looked like he had some problems subduing the unwilling Thief. But i quickly recognized the good old and practiced academy Cling-shift-gulp method come into play, skillfully performed. His meal went down without even being able to cause any more fuss. The Cadet even managed to stay on his feet through the entire devouring. His old instructors would have been proud.</p>

<p>I swear i saw a slight smugness to his face when heavily stepped back in rank between the other two Cadets.</p>

<p>The other thief, crew-mate of the Perked ear was a private named Finnik. She at least had backbone and stood straight and silent while she was read her sentencing. Nor did she did not struggle as i made her my meal. As a female this made her plumper form actually take a little effort to swallow down. I think i might have purred, i dont quite fully recall, but i did draw a few eyes in my eagerness to get her down to fill my gut.</p>

<p>First-officer Arn rounded up the little trial quickly enough and i retired to my cabin. I am pleased with today.</p>
