<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p><strong>-&ldquo;I have no questions Admiral!&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Grand Admiral shifted and raised a brow curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho? Im not sure if I should take your eagerness to serve as a positive sign or if I should worry about your lack of curiosity, But very well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This might end up being your greatest challenge, sailing into dangerous waters and keeping a new crew in order takes someone special. I have great hopes in you, if your reputation from the east is true, you should be well qualified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are great powers out there that might one day threaten the Awe. Its Captains that you that ensure that future young fluffs grow up safe and protected and that we do not suffer the same mistakes of the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Grand Admiral paced up close and carried with her a set of insignia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such responsibility should not be borne without the proper authority. You are thus hereby promoted to the rank of Admiral and all the rights that entail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With this rank you have the authority to promote, demote and otherwise dispose of crew as you see fit. While I recommend you show your authority early, try not to think with your belly too much.&ldquo; </p>
<p>Grand Admiral Weatherough grinned a rueful grin.

<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, Admiral Avolc.&rdquo;</p>
