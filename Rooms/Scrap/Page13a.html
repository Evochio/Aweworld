<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>I never expected the weather to be this rough! We&#39;re not even quite at the Sea of fangs yet, i never expected the waves to be this large.</p>

<p>The ship is holding so far, most of the crew are holed up below. Only the most skilled and bravest sailors are in the masts, tending the lines and forward sail. But we&#39;re all soaked and miserable on this ship one way or another.</p>

<p>It is soon my turn at the helm again. Perhaps i should take over entirely until we are in the clear.</p>

<hr />

<!--Put buttons to other rooms here. This is an HTML comment btw. -->
<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-1">Its a test of discipline, trust the crew</button>
<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-2">I got us in this mess, i'll get us out. </button>
