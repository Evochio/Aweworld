<p>Admirals log. Avolc Year 569</p>

<p>Hrystcrags</p>

<p>Day 1</p>

<p>I have been instructed to keep a detailed log of thoughts, decisions and events for the coming journey. The west sea is still very much uncharted and my records will help future captains make better decisions.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Perked ear&rdquo; is a remarkable vessel, a 3rd generation of Aweian Heavy Frigates, its built to withstand the rigors and hardships of the western sea while provide room and comfort for a sizable crew.</p>

<p>The crew, 148 souls (35 Raptorians, 110 Awes, 3 Wulfs) all in all are experienced and already well acquainted with the ship. I will be replacing a captain who for reasons left undisclosed to me is no longer available to command.</p>

<p>The challenge will be to assert my command early and make my authority absolute. I will have the assistance of first-mate Arn, who I am told commanded the ship ably on its return to port, but peculiarly either declined an offer of promotion to replace the late captain or were not seen as qualified.</p>

<p>Dwelling into the mysteries of the late captain will have to wait and my acquaintance with ship and crew will have to be brief, I have already received instruction to take the ship immediately to the Bay of spines and Sea of fangs. There will be plenty of time once we are at sea.</p>

<p>I both look forward to and dread the first upcoming role call and crew-inspection lineup later today, it will be my first meeting with the crew, first impressions will be important. Question is what kind of first impression i want to make.&nbsp;</p>
