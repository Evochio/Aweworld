<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>We retired to my cabin, as the crew set too their impromptu repair work and hauling some of our supplies over to the merchant ships hold.&nbsp; Captain Russel brought his daughter along, introducing her proudly and he seemed pleased and grateful&nbsp;for the aid offered.</p>

<p>He began recounting his tale while little Melon roamed cabin, fascinated by my knickknacks.</p>

<p>&quot;We were 2 months into our journey, just past Howlers point which separates the Sea of fangs from The great null sea. They were on us barely a day in, like they were watching the inlet. We tried to outrun them, but we had heavy cargo and trade from the Butterlands, we were low in the water...&quot;</p>

<p>The captain looked glum then. I could imagine what they were forced to do.</p>

<p>&quot;As they got closer they sent flyers to harass us, Gryphs by the look of it. Getting at our sails and dropping fire. It was pretty clear then they had no good intentions for any of my crew, i ordered the cargo dumped overboard, to get speed. Our men tried to hold the fliers off valiantly, alas some were carried off. We are not fighters!&quot;</p>

<p>He fixed me with a look but then shook his head and continued his tale.</p>

<p>&quot;There must have been something in the cargo we threw overboard that they valued higher then our ship and men. They soon veered off and gave up chase. Perhaps they thought they could catch up too us soon, a fire was blazing and we were taking in water from a hit of some sort of ballista on their forward bow.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked him about further armaments and crew compliment, but the captain had nothing much useful to add, seeming distraught. Perhaps the loss of some crew weighed heavily on him.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to be an Admiral!&quot; Little Melon suddenly squeaked with full conviction. This quickly brought a smile to both of us, the dark mood instantly dissipated.</p>

<p>&quot;One day, im sure you will be.&quot; I assured her and this made her beam and purr adorably.</p>

<p>The repairs would take a day.</p>

<p>Melon has asked to spend the night in the captains cabin. I appear to have become her idol.</p>
