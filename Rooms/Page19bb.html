<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>There&#39;s no telling where the next reef will be, the crew were unnerved enough as it is! I could see them stiff and nervous, gazing down at the foreboding waves, dreading the cold embrace of the sea and the appetites of stalking sea wolves.</p>

<p>I order us around and back on course. We did our duty to the best of our ability, but getting wrecked here will help nobody.</p>

<p>We make it back to the charted sailing lane safely and without further incident. One day someone will have to properly chart and map every reef and rock in this place, i do not envy them the task.</p>
