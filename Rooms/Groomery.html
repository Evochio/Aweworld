<div id="story-text">

<span class="hidden" id="around">
<p>Im approached, shortly after seeing off the Kingdom Trade-cruiser, by none other then the boats resident Matron. </p>

<p>While the largest Awe aboard, she's remarkable subtle in her movements and I dont notice her presence straight away. Elda is the kind of Awe that puts the heart at ease, with her perpetual soft smile and demeanor of unquestionable sincerity. </p>

<p>As an Matron-Awe in-charge of the ships physical and mental health, I couldn't have asked for a better candidate. </p>

<p>“May I borrow you for a few moments, dear captain?” She coos softly. In truth, she is the sole officer who could in some cases overrule and even order me around. But as true to her calling, she's all manners.</p>

<p>“Certainly” I respond hesitantly. Officers seldom come to visit the captain with good news. </p>

<p>"Just thought it was time we got a little aquinted dear captain, straighten out some of those tangles. No need to be tense." </p>

<p>We make our way to the heart of the ship. “The Groomery” as its sometimes called is located right in the mid-level center of the ship. It allows fast access to it from most parts of the ship. </p>

<p>The namesake itself is self-explanatory. A healthy coat is a healthy Awe. When there are no general medical needs, the nurses there provide much needed assisted grooming. <em>"Cleanly tangle-free fighters, or you invite the fluff-biters."</em> as the saying goes. </p>

<p>Today its empty and im guided into a chair and the Matron herself sets to fussing over the tangles in my mane with a large brush.</p>

<p>“How have your first weeks been, captain?” She murmurs conversationally. I know what this is, its my check-up of sorts. A firm stroke of brush and claw does its job at putting me at ease and relax.</p>

<p>“Certainly” I respond hesitantly. Officers seldom come to visit the captain with good news. </p>

<p>Perhaps this is just a follow-up checkup on my healed injuries. </p>

<p>She seems to sense my worry and smiles warmly and reassuringly</p>

<p>"Dont worry, im not here to steal you away into my pouch again. A return trip after an extended stay wouldnt be good for you anyway." She explains mysteriously "Just thought we should chat a while."</p>

<p>"Whats this about? Is something wrong with Nyxie?" I ask hesitantly. Officers seldom come to visit the captain with good news. </p>

<p>I cant help but eye the rounded bulge of my officer resting safely within her pouch. Elda seems to carry her with casual ease however. </p>

<p>"Oh no, everything is fine with her. She's being such a good little patient. I just thought it was time we talked" Elda replies casualy.</p>

<div class="moraleGood hidden"><p><strong>(Morale) Good</strong></p>
<p> “They been good. The crew has not given me trouble. They seem all seem capable. “ </p>

<p>“Yes, you've certainly managed to make an impression in a short time.” Elda seemed to coo in response.</p>

<p>“I had almost expected more friction toward a new captain.” I ponder aloud.</p>

<p>“Mmmh, what about that Tung fellow?” Elda probed gently.</p>
</div>


<div class="moralePoor hidden"><p><strong>(Morale) Could be better</strong></p>
<p>“Things could be better, im not deaf to the grumbling on the ship. I expected it to be difficult to captain a new crew I did not help pick. But some choices i've made have not been popular.” </p>


<p>Elda soothingly purred while she groomed.</p>

<p>“You have a task few Awes could do. Im sure the crew will become accustomed to your style of command.”</p>

<p>“So far, no one has outright done any acts of disobedience at least.” I mutter.</p>

<p>“Mmmh, what about that Tung fellow?” Elda probed gently </p>
</div>

<div class="moraleBad hidden"><p><strong>(Morale) Disatrous!</strong></p>
<p> "I know things are bad." I admitt in a low tone. Everywhere i go i get sour looks and angry stares. </p>

<p> "Its good that you know! But do you care, my captain?" Elda purred while she groomed. </p>

<p> "Ofcourse i care! But some of the choices i've made have been hard. But they had to be done." I respond resolutely. Im starting to wonder if this is some form of intervention. </p>

<p> "Your choices have been hard. Often done for the greater good of the fleet. But remember, ordinary sailors dont always see the bigger picture. Its day to day matters that are important." Elda sighs and continues. </p>

<p> "I dont normaly go this far, i try not to interfere. I normaly only listen and give comfort. But captain you are on very thin ice." </p>

<p> I let her words hang in the air a while before answering. </p>

<p> "What have you heard? I mean, so far no one has been outright disobedient." </p>

<p> "I listen, i do not speak, that would be a breach of trust. Though sometimes i ask questions. So lets start from the beginning." Elda spoke cooly.  "What about Officer Tung? </p>
</div>

<div class="tungFate hidden"><p><strong>The fate of Officer Tung</strong></p>

<span class="hidden" id="tung">
<p>“Well.. he isnt a problem anymore.” I smirk, unable to suppress a hint of self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Certainly not, it seems. You were quick to set a precedent and example.” The matron was efficient, but none too gentle in her grooming at spots. I had to grit my teeth at some of the strokes. </p>

<p>“You do not approve of my action?” </p>

<p>Elda clucked and held out one of my wings for long strokes of brush. </p>

<p>“Oh, no no, its not my position to judge anything dear Captain, dont take it as criticism. But I tend to my crews need, I hear their concerns and worries. “</p>

<p>“And do they worry i'll gobble them up at the first sign of challenging my authority?” I ask.</p>

<p>“Should they? You lead the way you see best Captain. Ultimate authority might be your way. Regardless, I look forward to seeing the results of your command.”</p>
</span>

<span class="hidden" id="notung">

<p>“Ah, Tung, the officer that challenged me? I have not heard any further grumbling from him since the initial meeting.” I cant help but frown.</p>

<p>“You showed patience when a different captain might have gotten themselves rid of a seeming troublemaker from the start.” The matron was efficient, but none too gentle in her grooming at spots. I had to grit my teeth at some of the strokes.</p>

<p>“You do not approve? What would you have done?”</p>

<p>Elda clucked with her tongue and held out one of my wings for long strokes of brush. </p>

<p>“Its not about what I would have done, dear Captain, im not here to criticise you. I tend to my crews needs, I hear their concerns and worries. So let me hear yours.“</p>

<p>“Is this what this talk is about? My choice in giving my crew the freedom to deepen or not? As the sole Pouch-Matron aboard, you feel my choice has compromised your position?” </p>

<p>“Oh, no Captain. Again, im not here to chastise you. Merely to listen and let you speak your thoughts." Elda squezzed my shoulders gently.</p>

<p>"Also whether you denied or approved general deepening, I will still be absorbing my share of injured or ailing crew who are unable to heal before this journey is over. How many really depends on your skill and aptitude.”</p>

<p>“You've made the trip into me once yourself, try not to make a habit out of it. Unless its something you prefer instead of commanding, in such case I am always open to your visit... or stay.” Elda purred and it seemed she had finished with her grooming. I felt refreshed and clean. But the ships Pouch-matrons words lingered with me. </p>

<p>Elda took her job as responsible for the crews health seriously. She was not afraid to give the captain a reality check and ask the hard questions. She was a strong Matron-Awe.</p>
