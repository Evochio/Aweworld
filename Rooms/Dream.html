<p>After the turbulent day of dealing with the gambling problem on the ship, im relieved to finally try to let things go back to normal. We are close to arriving at the start of Sea of fangs where pirate activity has been reported. Just another day or so if all goes well and we should start to see the small jagged islands and cliffs which dot this treacherous sea. We&#39;ll have to keep a close eye on the charts and our position. There are reefs here that appear to stick up out of nowhere in the middle of the sea which give the place their namesake. Our lookouts will have their work cut out for them.</p>

<p>But its the only way east and west that ships can handle. The tides and currents of the great sea north and south of this dangerous passage are unpredictable and terribly dangerous. I&#39;ve read reports of ships being blown and taken in circles by the great currents, loosing their bearing and finding themselves unable to escape for weeks.</p>
