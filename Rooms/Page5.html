<p>We are on the more open seas of the bay of spines. Wind is brisk and the weather has cleared, we have a good pace again, quickly making up for lost time.</p>

<p>Ship morale is stable, my cadets report the crew staying out of trouble. But its still early on the voyage.</p>

<p>I got a chance to talk to Packmaster Evoc of the Raptorians today. It seems the Raptorians, most of the time, keep to themselves on this ship, lightly tended by the Squires they trust. But that is hardly a surprise or anything uniquely new, they tend to prefer it that way and it is not because of any particular animosity toward Awes.</p>

<p>Still, it pays to make sure they are content and comfortable. You do not want 35 upset or bored Raptorians starting to consider change in diet and to make sport out of the rest of the crew. A hundred of us in these tight confines are almost no match and we&#39;d all soon find ourselves closely tied to Raptorian physiology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In any case, Packmaster Evoc, big brute of a raptorian, seems reliable and smart. He seems surprisingly quite taken to Cadet Ziggy, who i worried had been bothering them with her sometimes raucous merrymaking.</p>

<p>Speaking of Cadets, <em>Cadet </em>Glint has been subtly hinting but increasingly insisting on me attending to one of the evening services of the Order,&nbsp; &quot;To keep up appearances&quot;.</p>

<p>I have work to do, ive found some documents about the ships specifications that might be valuable but maybe i&#39;ll go, maybe not. I don&#39;t like to think me as a ships captain am held to responsibilities except mine own.</p>
