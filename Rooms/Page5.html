<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />

<p><em>Day 8</em></p>

<p><em>We are finally out of the gulf and out on the more open seas. Wind is brisk and we have a good pace again, quickly making up for lost time. </em></p>

<p><em>Ship morale is stable, my cadets report the crew staying out of trouble. </em></p>

<p>I got a chance to talk to Sergeant Evoc of the Raptorians today. It seems the Raptorians, most of the time, keep to themselves on this ship. But that is hardly a surprise or anything uniquely new, they tend to prefer it that way and it is not because of any particular animosity toward Awes.</p>

<p>Still, it pays to make sure they are content and comfortable. You do not want 35 upset or bored Raptorians starting to consider change in diet and to make sport out of the rest of the crew. A hundred of us in these tight confines are almost no match and we&#39;d all soon find ourselves closely tied to Raptorian physiology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In any case, Sergeant Evoc, big brute of a raptorian, seems reliable and smart. He seems surprisingly quite taken to Cadet Ziggy, who i worried had been bothering them with her sometimes raucous merrymaking.</p>

<p>Speaking of Cadets, <em>Cadet </em><em>Glint has been subtly hinting but increasingly insisting on </em>me attending to one of the evening services of the Order,&nbsp; &quot;To keep up appearances&quot;.</p>

<p>I have work to do, but maybe i&#39;ll go, maybe not. I don&#39;t like to think me as a ships captain am held to responsibilities except mine own.</p>
