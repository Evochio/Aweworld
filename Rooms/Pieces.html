<h1>Picking up Pieces</h1>
</div>
<div id="story-text">
<p> With the raptorian problem dealt with im still left with picking up the pieces of what that incident shattered. </p>

<p> Keeper is missing. And with him some possibly vital information i needed for our upcoming rendevouz. Despite him getting what he deserved for antagonizing the Raptorians, I failed in my charge to keep him safe and that will not look good on my record. </p>

<p> I've had his quarters and documents searched, but its a bit of an organized mess. Whatever the information he harbored for the exchange, it cannot be found. I've had all the papers scoured through by Cadets and some low-officers<span class="evokBelly hidden">, unable to attend myself due to my weight</span>. </p>

<p> It seems i'll be going into this meeting with our Wulf contacts somewhat blind. But what else is new on this journey. Im starting to feel like the whole Admirality just threw us out here with grand ambitions but little in the ways to prepare us for unforseen setbacks. </p>

<p> What we do find is that our contact is supposed to be a Captain Viriltri. Hopefully they will not question Keepers abscence too overtly. </p>

<span class="evokBelly hidden"><p>I also regret not having forethought about leaving the consuming of Evok till after the meeting. He is proving to be a literal huge hassle to break down and i have been bed bound for a day. For better or worse I will be showing off quite a gut in our meeting. </span>
