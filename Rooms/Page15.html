<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>Arn was not surprised to see me. He welcomed me cordially and with suitable respect and bade me sit down with him over a drink. It was slightly off-putting, considering the somewhat rugged nature I&#39;ve come to associate him with, to see him follow protocol and act gentleawely.</p>

<p>I confess he managed to quite guilefully distract me from the anger i initially felt going into this confrontation. Using formality as his tool, he got me sitting down and tackle this in an official manner. No matter, if this was the game he wanted to play, i was game.</p>

<p>&quot;You are here about the resumed gambling?&quot; he said once we were seated. Straight to the point, more to his character.</p>

<p>&quot;You are damned right i am!&quot; i said with slightly less tact that i immediately regretted. I stretched then and took a deep breath. I would not let temper run this conversation. &quot;My orders have been disobeyed and now i am down another Raptorian.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand, its unfortunate. But with respect, I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you that attrition like this is normal. Especially among Raptorians. I&#39;d venture to say we&#39;ve had quite a placid bunch of Raptorians, usually there is more trouble from them amongst eachother...&quot;</p>

<p>I had to interrupt him. It was something about his calm tone. He was trying to explain away the issue, avoiding the disobedience charge. I could eat people for less.</p>

<p>&quot;Which we have to commend the great leadership of Packmaster Evok for. There&#39;s no reason to rile them up!&quot; I leaned forward over the table to gaze into his eyes, gage his resolve in this. &quot;Fact still remains.. i ordered a lid on the games. You have gone behind my back and disobeyed these orders. Why should i not eat you here and now and move to end your little gambling racket before you&#39;ve even started to properly digest?&quot;</p>

<p>Arn picked his words carefully then, i could see the gears turning in his head, afterall, what he said next would determine the closeness of our future relationship.</p>

<p>&quot;It would be in your right, ofcourse, to do this.&quot; He leaned back in his chair, not to avoid my gaze, but to indignantly relax in face of threat. &quot;But as your First-officer i strongly recommend against such action, it might quickly prove to be an unhealthy choice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you mayhaps poisonous Arn?&quot; I chided.</p>

<p>&quot;No, not at all, no doubt im little of an obstacle for the mettle of an academy-trained Captains stomach. I mean the crew would look very poorly on any... aggressive actions.&quot; There was a threat veiled in that cordial and calm tone. I sensed a danger then that i hadn&#39;t fully taken into account. Arn continued, perhaps sensing my pause.</p>

<p>&quot;The games have become a familiar pass time for this crew, it was played long before your time on this ship and our late captain turned a blind eye too it. The mix of chance and skill mean anyone can pick up and play it and the risks involved are what make it all the more exciting. Sailors will always gamble, no matter what the high admiralty back in port judges. The game gives them an outlet for that with universally agreed upon rules so there&#39;s no grudges and bickering. Is that not reasonable?&quot;</p>

<p>While Arn talked, it struck me that i didn&#39;t hear about the resumed play of this game until the Packmaster reported it. None of the crew had stepped up to report the infraction, even my cadets have been in the dark. It meant most of them were on Arns side in this. Still, i could not back down from this now this far into it.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not agree with these &quot;Risks&quot;. Attrition is normal, yes, but encouraging it with this kind of gambling can only lead to trouble. Especially if it antagonizes the Raptorians!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No one has forced the Raptorians to play. They&#39;re not bad gamblers, some have just taken too steep risks and paid for it. Besides, have you even tried the game, you&#39;d see its quite fair if you did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Its not about whether its fair or not, i have to minimize the &#39;risks&#39; to the crew so we have the highest likelihood of success on our journey.&quot; I snapped.</p>

<p>&quot;Its in your right to command the games stopped once and for all, of course. Or charge us to no longer allow high-stakes that lead to loss of crew. But im telling you now, the crew will feel it unfair.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Its your job as first-officer to control the crew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And its what i&#39;ve been doing!&quot; Arn sighed then and crossed his arms and sighed. &quot;I know you cant back down without having your authority undermined captain. I figure theres one way we can settle this which will keep the crew happy, no matter the results. Play me for it in a game. If you win, we&#39;ll back down or do whatever you command. Thats properly high stakes, is it not? The crew would accept and even welcome that.&quot;</p>

<p>Arn was trying to confuse the issue, draw away the blame and make new rules. I had to decide then what to do.</p>

<p>Stay the course, forbid the games again and with a final warning or even eat Arn here and now for allowing this to go on behind my back. Or perhaps find a compromise, take away the risks of it and forbid money and debt to be involved in gambling. Sure they&#39;d mutter about it but get to keep their precious game then.</p>

<p>Or perhaps i&#39;d teach them all a lesson in their own turf. Its suited me to play ignorant of this game and its rules so far.</p>
