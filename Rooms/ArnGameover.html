<h1>A new Captain</h1>
</div>
<div id="story-text">
<p>All the pieces of the puzzles started to fall into place at the same time as i stared down into the smug gaping jaws of my First-officer. They held me tight, i could only shudder and groan as he licked over my face and then had them lower me down into the salivating warm maw and darkness enclosed me.</p>

<p>I kicked at my captors, trashing in their grips, but there was no escaping Arns maw. With a shove my snout slid down over his tongue and squelched into his tight gullet.</p>

<p>I was mad! I felt my foot manage a mighty kick in someones face who&#39;d be nursing a bruise for quite some time. But that wouldnt help me now.</p>

<p>He swallowed me, he did so with no hesitation or remorse. The muscles convulsed and dragged me into his body, stretching his neck and gullet. They hadn&#39;t even bothered to remove my gear, i was going down as the captain i was.</p>

<p>I groaned at the tightness and discomfort of being physically jammed down into someone elses body. I had experienced this only in mock training in my academy days, i knew 1 on 1 techniques that were useless now with a whole crew versus me. The training had no prepared me for the real thing, the pure reality of the fact that you were being devoured alive. It was over before i knew it. Arn had me packed away in his gut. Tight, hot and humiliated i could barely squirm. I felt him pat at me then and chuckle, the way you pat a full and content gut after a good meal. Thats all i was now.</p>

<p> <br /> </p>

<p> Other then in Arns belly, there was an innitial uproar on the ship. Accusations of mutiny and threat of a fight emerging in the captains fading life and honor loomed. But facts remained that Captain Avolc had voluntarilly agreed to the rules, something all present testified, even a forlorn looking Cadet Ziggy. </p>
<p> Your legacy as a captain of the west-sea was short. As a paunch on First-officer and now acting captain Arn, you at least aided in some way to the authority on the ship, but also a reminder to never foolishly gamble without knowing all the stakes.</p>
