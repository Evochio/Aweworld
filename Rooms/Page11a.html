<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>We retired quickly to my cabin and Captain Russel was very disappointed to hear that we would not be of greater assistance to their plight.</p>

<p>I assured him he&#39;d make port if he kept reasonable pace, there were no overt sign of storms coming.&nbsp; We&#39;d also have a greater chance of catching the once responsible if we left immediately.</p>

<p>With some reluctance the Captain recounted his tale.</p>

<p>&quot;We were 2 months into our journey, just past Howlers point which separates the Sea of fangs from The great null sea. They were on us barely a day in, like they were watching the inlet. We tried to outrun them, but we had heavy cargo and trade from the Butterlands, we were low in the water...&quot;</p>

<p>The captain looked glum then. I could imagine what they were forced to do. The captain took a swallow of offered drink and continued.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;As they got closer they sent flyers to harass us, Gryphs by the look of it. Getting at our sails and dropping fire. It was pretty clear then they had no good intentions for any of my crew, i ordered the cargo dumped overboard, to get speed. Our Awes tried to hold the fliers off valiantly, alas some were carried off. We are not fighters!&quot;</p>

<p>He fixed me with an accusing glare that said &#39;Where were you!? The Admirality is&nbsp;supposed to protect us, these routes...!&#39;, but he paused, composed himself and wisely refrained from further impoliteness and continued his tale.</p>

<p>&quot;There must have been something in the cargo we threw overboard that they valued higher then our ship and men. They soon veered off and gave up chase. Perhaps they thought they could catch up too us soon, a fire was blazing and we were taking in water from a hit of some sort of ballista&nbsp;on their forward bow.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked him about further armaments and crew compliment, but the captain had nothing much useful to add. No doubt mourning the loss of his profits.</p>

<p>We separated ships before noon and were off again. The captains daughter cheerfully waved us off.</p>
