<p> The officers leave hastily, already there are a line of lower officers outside our room waiting for instructions or to deliver reports. It will be a busy day for everyone </p>

<p> Officer Mirr lingers parchment in paw, its the list of injured, lost and unaccounted. I spot Ziggys name among the casualties and point to it. </p>

<p> "Ah... Cadet Ziggy. Yes, i almost forgot. She's below deck, i think you should go see her. She's unhurt but... not okay." Mirr replies softly.</p>

<p> "If there's something you think i can do to help her, i'll go have a look at her." We nod to one another. Everyone knows what to do. </p>

<p> Im pointed to the cadet by a very busy nurse. There is little i can do to the physically wounded without getting in the way at the moment. </p>

<p> The usually lively and rambunctious cadet sits in a sunken posture, hidden away in a corner. I would never have spotted or noticed her had i not been pointed directly at her. </p>

<p> At my pressence she turns and at the sight of me seems to balk and cringe in what seems like fear before she suddenly sniffles and lowers her wings and ears in the most pitiful display of shame and sorrow. </p>

<p> "C-captain... i-im sorry!" She whimpers quietly, as if not to be overheard, but soon words fall out of her rapidly. "When the thunder started I... B-blomm was hit, just gone, I-I couldnt even fight back. If i'd stood where he stood...!" She shook her head rapdily "I.. froze... i hid. " She looked up at me, her eyes misty, ashamed. She unsuccesfully fought back a sob. </p>

<p>In her first test of real battle she'd had a shock, panicked and hidden away. No doubt she wasent the only one, but out of all Awes she was the most unexpected. My brave cadets fascade is in tatters, her spirit is broken.</p>

<p> The other cadets i had seen moving about earlier and exchanged words with. They had faired better, shook up but on their feet and keeping busy. I wonder what to say to my Cadet. She is shaking with tension still, remnants of shock perhaps. </p>
</div>

<div class="kindness hidden">
<p> Kindness after such an ordeal, such a shock, might be what my young cadet needs. She might have overburdened herself with expectations, hid her fears away until the very last moment for when she had to face them and was overwhelmed. </p>

<p> Whatever the case, i put a paw on her shoulder gently and step close, shielding her from sight from others in the crowded infirmary, hiding her under a wing. She doesent need words, just someone to give trust and understanding. </p>

<p> Her shoulders shake with quiet sobs as she leans in and lets go of her pent-up tension and fear. She lets her tears and dissapointment flow out of her while i stand staunchly by her side. After a while she seems more relaxed and at peace. </p>

<p> I give her shoulder another squezze and tell her to rest for the rest of the day and report in when she feels ready. </p>

<p> Ziggy nods, unable to face me. But she looks relieved. She had feared facing me. Feared how i'd react to her cowardice. But she forgets i once too was a cadet.</p>

</div>

<div class="tough hidden">
<p> "Ziggy" I murmur low and put a paw on her shoulder. She seems to tense at the touch. "We are not flawless, no one expected you to be the hero." I squezze her shoulder gently but firmly.</p>

<p> "But you set yourself up to be one. Hid away your tensions behind a mask of bravado." Ziggy looks down, unable to meet my gaze, ashamed. "You cannot hide from yourself, or you'll end up overwhelmed by what you refused to face when it matters!" </p>

<p> "S-so i must accept that im a coward?" Whimpered Ziggy in a low pained voice, glancing up at me. </p>

<p> "You must accept that you're afraid! Only then might you learn to face it." I said and held up one of my paws infront of her. It was shaking. All the adrenaline and fear of the battle was slowly leaving my body. Ziggy stared at my shaking paw and then up at me. She swallowed hard and sighed deeply </p>

<p> She looked defeated still, but she seemed relieved i was not here to punish her for her cowardice. </p>

<p> "Thank you captain. I'll... try my best." </p>

<p> "Just be true to yourself." I picked up her cadets hat that lay on the ground next to her and placed it back on her head. She pulled it down low over her brow to hide her teared up eyes. </p>

<p> Ziggy would need time to recover, i told her to rest a while and then report for duties, it was best not to wallow in self-pity for too long. I remember my first battle myself. I didnt quite hide, but i certainly was no help to no one. </p>
