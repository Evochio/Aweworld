<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>&quot;You&#39;ve made your point well enough Arn&quot; I had to concede in the end. &quot;I understand this passtime of yours and the crews have become important for you.&quot; I sighed and held up a paw before Arn could speak.</p>

<p>&quot;But the fact still remains that you all went behind my back with this. You can keep your games, but all further gambling with currency and debts are over. Likewise all current standing debts people might have are wiped!&quot; Arn was about to protest, i raised my voice further and put some steel behind it, not giving him a chance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;These are my final words on this! And i will make sure they&#39;re followed through! I catch any word, hint or sniff of anyone disobeying these restrictions you can count on YOU and the party responsible getting to get a visit to the captains quarters. Though i promise you, you&#39;ll be riding on my hips when going there!&quot;</p>

<p>Arn settled back down and only gave a curt nod. It was a loss for him, there&#39;d no doubt be quite a bit of grumbling from the crew. But this way i&#39;d ensure we stayed intact as a crew.</p>
