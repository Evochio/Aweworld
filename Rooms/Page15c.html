<h1>To bet or not to bet</h1>

<p>The Raptorians got themselves in this mess and they&#39;ll have to get themselves out of it. I cant go interfering and micro-managing individual gambling debts, what kind of captain would that make me?</p>

<p>No, since i&#39;ve allowed the games to take place i cant undo it because someone complains.</p>

<p>I can however assign Ziggy to help them improve their play. Or better yet, refrain from getting further in debt!</p>

<p>I hear she's on good terms with the Raptorians and somewhat of a player herself. She's been itching to proove herself worthy of extra duties anyway. </p>
