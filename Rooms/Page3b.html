<p><em>Admirals log. Avolc</em></p>

<p><em>Day 4</em></p>

<p><em>We have made good progress; favorable winds have put us ahead of schedule. The ship is fast and the crew knows her well. I expect us to arrive at the Sea of fangs in 3 weeks.</em></p>

<p><em>The crew is being obedient in their duties and shown no overt signs of animosity towards me or the cadets. The cadets are in fact blending in well and have become something of good luck charms for the crew.&nbsp; I have made sure to patrol the ship daily, learn its ins and outs and make myself seen and learn names. </em></p>

<p><em>I haven&#39;t had much of an appetite but I joined the senior crew in the joint mess for the first time. Ship-rations never sat with me well, but i made jovial enough conversation with the rest of the crew and im sure a few warmed up a little. I think im starting to understand now what kind of captain this crew needs. </em></p>
