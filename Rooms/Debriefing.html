<div id="story-text">

<p>My officers sat assembled for the debriefing. At least the ones still around or who I were not immediately needed elsewhere or being patched up, like my Arms officers. They were a motley dirty and fur-fluffed bunch, all in some way showing signs of battle and stress. Some were injured, although lightly, others had a haunted post-battle look too them. But they were well-trained, they all had kept their composure where lesser Awes would have curled up to hide. </p>

<p>An iron ball lay upon the table, a recovered projectile of what they had been shooting at us.</p>

<p> Outside the room was the distinct noise and bustle of crew hard at work with their appointed tasks for clean-up and repair. We had to make this quick, there was much to do. </p>

<div class="retreated hidden">

<p>“We've made our escape and they have ceased their pursuit.” I felt tense. Out first encounter and battle had been a disaster. A part of me wanted to turn around for a second round. But our mission had to come first. Their weapons were too much of a uncertainty. I met the gaze of my officers. “We are continuing on with our objectives. This is not a fight we can risk take at this moment.” I turned to Tick.</p> 

<p> "How is the ship? Will we have problems reaching Thousand Islands?”</p>

<p>Tick, my ship maintenance officer looked soaked and like he'd rather be elsewhere and I understood his need. This was the time his expertise and leadership over repair would be needed the most.</p>

<p>“'The Attentive' has sustained some damage, but only one of the 'Impacts' were critical and at water level. We took in some water but the breach has been fixed.” Tick responded speech rapid and impatient while fidgeting with one of his measuring tools.</p>

<p> “I approve of your choice to pull back.” Tick looked marginally pleased. “A sustained fight would have been potentially disastrous. With more accurate fire they could have easily dealt us critical irreparable damage with ease!”  </p>
<p>“We may have fled this fight to gather our wits and reassess, but I don't intend to make a habit out of this Officer Tick. Next time we know what we're up against. Is there any way to protect the ship against this?”  I rolled the iron ball projectile under my paw, it was heavy.  </p>
<p>“No, one projectile pierced right through hull and copper plating, so not without armoring a whole ship like the ramming-bow and thats not possible. The weight would be too much.” Tick huffed.  </p>
<p>“The armored bow makes the ship dip dangerously low in hard weather as it is. I cant imagine a fully armored ship could be sailed.” Nyxie added. </p>

<p>“How is the crew, what are our casualties?”  I turned towards Mirr, our crew-officer.</p>

<p><p><span class="mirr hidden">First Officer</span> Mirr had a distant look on her face, the usually eloquent officer has not escaped unruffled herself, the fur on her paws were stained faintly crimson. She blinked once and locked her eyes with mine.</p>

<p>“Confused, dazed, but focused on their tasks. We have 30 reported injured, most of them light. <span class="crewbattle"><script>displayCrewBattle()</script></span> have turned to the spirits or missing.”</p>

<p>I drummed my paws on the table. I knew this would happen, but it was never easy to hear. I did not let the silence stretch for too long. I turned to Nyxie.</p>

<p>“Maintain course westward. How long until we are in sight of the first isles?”</p>

<p>Nyxie my navigator had her arm in a sling, but she looked unconcerned with it. She seemed to be coping well with having been at the helm of that fight, but the frazzled look of her fur betrayed the stress she'd been going through.</p>

<p>“Aye captain. A week with good winds. We are on the westward current now so it will not take longer then two regardless of weather.”</p>

<span class="arn hidden"><p>Arn sat silently, face a brooding mask and hard to read. It was partly thanks to him that we made out escape, he managed to coordinate the sails and crew in the masts to give us maximum speed. But he seemed to have little to say or add to the table. </p></span>

<span class="tung hidden"><p>“That was a close trim, but you saw us through in one piece captain.” First-Officer Tung rubbed his snout thoughtfully. </p>

<p>“There are a lot of things I would have done differently in that battle were I the captain. And that just shows I still have a lot to learn from you.”</p></span>

<span class="garsch hidden"><p>“The important thing is that we survived. The crew has tasted its first battle. But I sense many more to come. We must be ready for them.” First-Officer Garsch, who had been sitting quietly concluded.</p></span>

<p>“Very well. Back to your duties everyone.”</p>


</div>

<div class="desperate hidden">

<p>The battle had taken a lot out of everyone, around the ship before assembling everyone here the scene had been the same all around. Slumped and worn, Awes trying to recover their senses and will to move from hard battle we just faced. </p>

<p>I feel the weight of fatigue myself and my coat is uncomfortably wet still. I wish for nothing more then to sleep under the sun and get dry. Still, as the commander of this crew, there is little time to relax. Especially now.</p>

<p>Its a dejected, ruffled and worn out selection of Awes sitting around the conference table of our briefing room however. <div class="arn">Only Arn appeared to be attentively waiting for things to proceed, eyes firm.</div></p>

<p>I thud the table loudly with a large iron ball against the table, it startles most at attendance and their eyes seem to focus and turn toward me.</p>

<p>“We won.” I state calmly. “We faced a new threat but we perservered and won. Thats what matters right now.” I look at my officers, each in turn. “Now we must pick up the pieces and move on. Tick, how is the ship?”</p>

<p>Tick, my ship maintinance officer looked haggard, soaked and like he'd rather be elsewhere. The debriefing had to wait on him to arrive and be able to attend for a minute. He had a lot of work to do around the ship. He got straight to the point.</p>

<p>“We've suffered extreme damage. We are literally picking up the pieces you've mentioned in some places. But we are afloat and I should be able to keep us that way. Most breaches are clean and the serious ones were plugged before we flooded.” Tick was fidgeting with his measuring tool while he spoke. It was rare to see him so animated and outspoken.</p>

<p>“Im glad to hear this. “The Attentive” is tough and stood up well against tehse unknown thunder-weapons it seems. We'll be able to carry on to Thousand islands then I assume?”</p>

<p>Tick frowned and looked unhappy.</p>

<p>“We should make it there, but we'll need repairs that cant be done at open sea. I credit our survival to luck and our foes lack of good aim. Just because we survived, I must be clear, we CANNOT take sustained fire like that. Captain, I advice we take flight if we encounter a threat again.”</p>

<p>“Noted” I replied, displeased by his outburst. He was out of line, but I understood his concern and let it slide. I turned toward Mirr.</p>

<p>“How are the crew, what are our casualties?”</p>

<p><p><span class="mirr hidden">First Officer</span> Mirr had a distant look on her face, the fur on her paws were faintly crimson. She blinked once and locked her eyes with mine.</p>

<p>“Exhausted, demoralized and near breaking. There are more injured then uninjured and i've yet to assertain how many we lost but I estimate up to  <span class="crewbattle"><script>displayCrewBattle()</script></span>.”</p>

<p>I drummed my paw on the table, the news stung. The battle had been a disaster. But we were still alive.  I turned to Nyxie<span class="nyxie hidden"> my First-Officer, but at the moment still in charge of navigation.</span></p>

<p>“Maintain course westward. How long until we are in sight of the first isles?”</p>

<span class="nyxie hidden">
<p>Nyxie had her arm in a sling, the frazzled look of her fur betrayed the stress she'd been going through. Her paws were quivering. This had been a tough battle for her, with her first day on the job as First-officer.</p>
<p>“Aye captain. A week with good winds. We are on the westward current now so it will not take longer then two regardless of weather.” She looked like she had more to say, but after the meeting.</p>

</span>
<span class="tung hidden"><p>“That was a fight unlike any other. But you saw us through in one piece captain.” First-Officer Tung rubbed his snout thoughtfully. </p>

<p>“There are a lot of things I would have done differently in that battle were I the captain. Im not sure i could have done better, but that we survived at all seemed down to luck.”</p>

<p>I couldnt help but frown bitterly. </p>
</span>

<span class="garsch hidden"><p>“We misjudged the strength of our enemies. But the important thing is that we survived. The crew has tasted its first hard battle. But there may be more to come. We must be better prepared for them and not let the events of today repeat themselves.” First-Officer Garsch, who had been sitting quietly concluded.</p></span>

<div class="arn">
<p> "Very well, if there was nothing else..."

<p>Arn, who had been silently glowering in a brooding manner at the corner of the table finally spoke up. </p>

<p>"That was more then a close shave captain, its a miracle we're still alive! The whole order of battle was a disaster. I have no aspirations for captaincy, you know that. But, for the good of the crew, you better change your tactics." </p>

<p> The table fell into an uncomfortable silence as the First-Officer and I held our gazes locked. It was no mild admonishent i had recieved. </p>

<p> "Are you suggesting that you'd do a better job Arn?" I drummed the table with my claws </p>

<p> "It'd be a feat to do worse." Before i could reply to such an open insult he raised his paws and continued. "Punish me if you must, but it needed to be said."</p>

<p> I found myself grinding my teeth. Arn could be such a infuriating fluffbiter. But somehow i felt it was justified. I would not push this further, it would lead nowhere good when there were more important matters at hand. </p>

<p> "Back to your duties" I dismissed with a hiss. </p> 
</div>

<p> The table fell into an uncomfortable silence as the First-Officer and I held our gazes locked. It was no mild admonishent i had recieved. But somehow i felt it was justified.</p>
  
<p> "Are you suggesting that..." I started but he interrupted me firmly. </p>

<p> "The crew has lost faith in you. Resign to my belly right now, let me take over peacefully. You might be able to recover this through me." There was only firm determination on Arns face.</p>
</div>

<div class="boarded hidden">

<p>“We have driven them off and it looks like they are in retreat.” I spoke calmly. “I have chosen not to pursue. Our main objectives lie elsewhere and it feels ever more important we reach the fleet.” No one objects to my decision. I did not expect them too. “How is the ship? Will we have problems reaching Thousand Islands?”</p>

<p>Tick, my ship maintenance officer looked soaked and like he'd rather be elsewhere and I understood his need. This was the time his expertise and leadership over repair would be needed the most.</p>

<p>“'The Attentive' has sustained damage, but only one of the 'Impacts' were critical and at water level. We took in some water but the breach has been fixed.” Tick responded speech rapid and impatient while fidgeting with one of his measuring tools.</p>

<p>“It sounds like the ship stood up well in her first battle against these unknown thunder-weapons.” I ventured optimistically, rolling the iron ball under my paw, it was heavy. I had expected much worse news.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think that might be some credit to luck, our foes choice of targets or lack of aim. Save for our armored ramming-bow, we CANNOT take sustained fire like that. Captain, I advice we take flight if we encounter such a threat again.” Tick spoke harshly. It was out of order for him to recommend action like that, but I saw it was out of genuine concern then cowardice.</p>

<p>“Noted, but we are not out here to flee our foes at first sight. We are a warship.” I turned towards Mirr, our crew-officer.</p>

<p>“How is the crew, what are our casualties?”</p>

<p><span class="mirr hidden">First Officer</span> Mirr had a distant look on her face, the usually eloquent officer has not escaped unruffled herself, the fur on her paws were stained faintly crimson. She blinked once and locked her eyes with mine.</p>

<div class="explosion hidden">

<p>“A devastating and sudden victory” I spoke calmly. “It seems the cost of such power comes with a great risk.” Everyone assembled seem a bit dazed still. It would take time to process this encounter. </p>

<p> “How is the ship? Will we have problems reaching Thousand Islands?”</p>

<p>Tick, my ship maintenance officer looked soaked and like he'd rather be elsewhere and I understood his need. This was the time his expertise and leadership over repair would be needed the most.</p>

<p>“'The Attentive' has sustained damage, but only one of the 'Impacts' were critical and at water level. We took in some water but the breach has been fixed. That blast tore our sails to tatters, it will take some time to put up the spares.” Tick responded speech rapid and impatient while fidgeting with one of his measuring tools. He sighed. "It will take many nights of mending and sewing to repair."</p>

<p>“It sounds like the ship stood up well in her first battle against these unknown thunder-weapons.” I ventured optimistically, rolling the iron ball under my paw, it was heavy. I had expected much worse news.</p>

<div class="resignation hidden">

<p> The Officers file out to do their respective duties. But my new First-officer remains. </p>
<div class="nyxie hidden">
<p>Nyxie hands me her First-officers insignia.</p>

<p>“C-captain. I don't know how to say this. But I don't think I'm cut out for this job. <br />
In that battle there. I was entirely overwhelmed. If you had not shouted at me what to do, I would been frozen on the spot. All I could think of was to steer the ship the way you wanted me to. I totally forgot about being the First-officer!” Nyxie squeaked distraught and shook her head. “I let so many people down who came to me for guidance!”</p>

<p>“It was not the kindest first day for a First-Officer Nyxie. I understand you were overwhelmed.” I try to reassure her. </p>

<p>“No captain, I do not want to do it, i-i-im so sorry! Im out of my depths, I only wish to sail, steer and navigate large beautiful ships! And its not fair to the crew to have someone like me in this position. If you want to demote me or punish me thats o-okay. I understand.” </p>

<p>Nyxie lowered her head, as if to await my wroth and judgment. I can only exhale slowly and put a paw to her shoulder and squeeze gently. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="mirr hidden">
<p>Mirr meets my eyes with a firm and ashamed look. </p>

<p>“I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you, Captain.” She sighed. “I wish to step down as First-officer.” </p>

<p>I feel my fur bristle involuntarily. Mirr, having anticipated my disappointment quickly speaks. </p>

<p>“All that chaos of battle. I'm trained for it, in my head I knew what to do. I don't think I even had time to feel afraid. But I'm not an Awe who leads others into battle.” She held up her sword and looked at it with disdain. <br />
“I know how to defend myself, I know where to cut and when to dodge. But after today... I do not have the spirit of battle. I cant be the one that tells others where to go bleed and perish, I do not have the heart and I hope you can respect that, my captain. I'm sorry.” </p>

<p>She handed the First-officers insignia back at me, and stared into my eyes intently.</p>
