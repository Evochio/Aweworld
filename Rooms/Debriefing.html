<h1>Debriefing</h1>

<div id="story-text">
<p>My officers sat assembled for the debriefing. At least the ones still around or who I were not immediately needed elsewhere or being patched up. They were a motley dirty and fur-fluffed bunch, all in some way showing signs of battle and stress. Some were injured, although lightly, others had a haunted post-battle look too them. But they were well-trained, they all had kept their composure where lesser Awes would have curled up to hide. </p>

<p>An iron ball stood upon the table, a recovered projectile of what they had been shooting at us.</p>

<p> Outside the room was the distinct noise and bustle of crew hard at work with their appointed tasks for clean-up and repair. We had to make this quick, there was much to do. </p>

<div class="retreated hidden">

<p>“We've made our escape and they have ceased their pursuit.” I felt tense. Out first encounter and battle had been a disaster. A part of me wanted to turn around for a second round. But our mission had to come first. Their weapons were too much of a uncertainty. I met the gaze of my officers. “We are continuing on with our objectives. This is not a fight we can risk take at this moment.” I turned to Tick.</p> 

<p> "How is the ship? Will we have problems reaching Thousand Islands?”</p>

<p>Tick, my ship maintenance officer looked soaked and like he'd rather be elsewhere and I understood his need. This was the time his expertise and leadership over repair would be needed the most.</p>

<p>“'The Attentive' has sustained damage, but only one of the 'Impacts' were critical and at water level. We took in some water but the breach has been fixed.” Tick responded speed rapid and impatient while fidgeting with one of his measuring tools.</p>

<p>“It sounds like the ship stood up well in her first battle against these unknown thunder-weapons.” I ventured optimistically, rolling the iron ball under my paw, it was heavy. I had expected much worse news.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think that might be some credit to luck, our foes choice of targets or lack of aim. Save for our armored ramming-bow, we CANNOT take sustained fire like that. Captain, I advice we take flight if we encounter such a threat again.” Tick spoke harshly. It was out of order for him to recommend action like that, but I saw it was out of genuine concern then cowardice.</p>

<p>“Noted, but we are not out here to flee our foes at first sight. We are a warship.” I turned towards Mirr, our crew-officer.</p>

<p>“How is the crew, what are our casualties?”</p>

<p>Mirr had a distant look on her face, the usually eloquent officer has not escaped unruffled herself, the fur on her paws were stained faintly crimson. She blinked once and locked her eyes with mine.</p>

<p>“Confused, dazed, but focused on their tasks. We have 30 reported injured, most of them light. 9 have turned to the spirits or missing.”</p>

<p>I drummed my paws on the table. I knew this would happen, but it was never easy to hear. I did not let the silence stretch for too long. I turned to Nyxie.</p>

<p>“Maintain course westward. How long until we are in sight of the first isles?”</p>

<p>Nyxie my navigator had her arm in a sling, but she looked unconcerned with it. She seemed to be coping well with having been at the helm of that fight, but the frazzled look of her fur betrayed the stress she'd been going through.</p>

<p>“Aye captain. A week with good winds. We are on the westward current now so it will not take longer then two regardless of weather.”</p>

<span class="arn hidden"><p>Arn sat silently, face a brooding mask and hard to read. It was partly thanks to him that we made out escape, he managed to coordinate the sails and crew in the masts to give us maximum speed. But he seemed to have little to say or add to the table. </p></span>

<p>“Very well. Back to your duties everyone.”</p>

<p>“We have driven them off and it looks like they are in retreat.” I spoke calmly. “I have chosen not to pursue. Our main objectives lie elsewhere and it feels ever more important we reach the fleet.” No one objects to my decision. I did not expect them too. “How is the ship? Will we have problems reaching Thousand Islands?”</p>

<p>“Confused, dazed, but focused on their tasks. We have 50 reported injured, most of them light. 23 have turned to the spirits or missing.”</p>

<p>I drummed my paws on the table. I knew this would happen, but it was never easy to hear. I did not let the silence stretch for too long. I turned to Nyxie.</p>
