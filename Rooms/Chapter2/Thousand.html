<p>Our homeland of Aweland lays far behind us. Our journey has taken us past the perilous Sea of Fangs and the gap of open sea past Pale-Rock. </p>

<p>We are now at Thousand islands. A name for an archipelago sea that really does not give it justice for the amount of islands this region has. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>This region of sea is vast, its a few weeks sailing in width but stretches far north and south in a band of shallow sea not unlike the Sea of fangs. Unlike the fangs, the islands here are larger and far more hospitable and home to many island-hopping Gryph Islanders. </p>


<p>Our purpose here is to find our war-fleet, which have sailed here a few months earlier. A fleet thats here to root out the pirate infestation thats been responsible for harassing a large part of Awe trade shipping and behind a brazen raid upon Thunderhill, a peaceful sizable coastal-town back on our homeland. Citizen were kidnapped and large parts of the port set ablaze. </p>

<p>The leadership back home fear this is part of a larger conspiracy toward Aweland. </p>

<p>We are effectively in a state of war until the truth is uncovered and justice has been served! </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>We are carrying supplies, reinforcements and information for our fleet. But first we must find them in this maze of islands.</p>

<p>We have several preset navigational points of interest to help us. Rallying and convergence points where our fleet or signs of it could be found.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Upon arriving at our first “Nav point”, a waiting scout of the fleet found us and brought dire news. </p>

<p>The fleet is in trouble. The pirates are more dangerously armed with weapons never seen before. Our own perilous encounter with one by Pale-rock was a dangerous testament to that. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The scouts report is sketchy at best. They were stationed here early upon arriving in this region after the fleet engaged a group of suspected pirates and were battered into withdrawing from the fight. </p>

<p>If the Scouts report is to be believed, they have been hounded around the Thousand islands since.</p>

<p>However, if they had been so outmatched and chosen to retreat, we should have encountered the fleet or elements of it returning to Aweland on our way here. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>We have to find them and the truth of the matter. </p>
