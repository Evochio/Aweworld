<p>The island regions are getting denser and denser now. From what we've gathered, we should be in the region the fleet is actively operating in. Unless they've had some large change of plans and moved en masse to some other location, an idea which makes me feel like shedding. </p>

<p>There should be more villages of Islanders around here to question. I find it highly unlikely that they would not have seen or heard something about the fleet the size of ours operating around their shores.</p>

<p> (Our prisoner is from around here too. Perhaps its worth to see what they might know and what stakes they have in working with or against us.) </p>

<p> The Kaelani tribe are the largest of the tribes around here. They are even conveniently mentioned in one of my intelligence attachments to my map (More if islanders). Kudos to the Admiralty for that one. </p>

<p>I've set course for the main cluster of islands where their settlements should reside. This will be pure information gathering, I will try to keep our visit here brief.</p>

<p>We've spotted several small Islander fishing vessels. They are quick nimble little things, they seem to have no interests in interacting with us what so ever, darting away around islands or onto shallow waters to avoid us. </p>

<p>They appear to not be very trusting or welcoming around here. Perhaps there is a reason.</p>

<div class="settlement hidden"><p><strong>Settlement</strong></p>
<p>We sail around the various islands for a few hours. Though they are more dense in number in this chain of isles, many of them are small craggy. Not all of them have sufficient foliage or high cliffs to protect against the worst of the elements.  Many of them appear to have traces of some manner of cultivation or other upon them. </p>

<p>Eventually Look-out reports seeing a fair-sized settlement on the high-ground of on one cluster of heavily wooded isles.  I've ordered us closer to investigate.  The waters appear deep here and we are able to get our ship quite close to the island.  There is no welcome or anyone come to greet us however, though its clear the settlement is inhabited and populated.</p>

</div>

<div class="catch hidden"><p><strong>Catching a Fisher</strong></p>
<p>Try as we might, the small vessels keep eluding us.  They are definitely very wary or afraid of Awe vessel, or perhaps just big vessels in general. Its a curious thing.  As the day progresses we come close to catching one, corning it in the bay of an island. But the Islander beached his vessel upon the moderately wooded isle and darted into the foliage to get away. </p>

<p>I'm sure the scouts could track them down eventually. But we risk spending all day combing the woods for this fellow who might turn out to know nothing.</p>
</div>

<div class="catch2 hidden"><p><strong></strong>Catching a Fisher</p>
<p>The Scouts do not take very long in locating the Islander. I have them picked up by boat along with the captured Fisher-Gryph.  It turns out the Islander is a female Gryph of fiery temper. One of the scouts is nursing a blow to the head and looking peeved as they board the ship. </p>

<p>The female Islander was a slender one, she had a sandy colored plumage with black tipped feathers around her tail-feathers and wingtips. Her face and eyes was likewise decorated in a ring of black and she was scowling hard at everyone around her, though her arms were restrained behind her back. </p>

<p>I could interrogate her myself. However, I feel I need to give my officers more experience, so I need to decide who should do it.</p>
</div>

<div class="report hidden"><p><strong></strong>Settlement Report</p>
<p>The Island is quite tall and has a protected fertile little valley nestled between two major cliffs which dominate the Isle. The settlement seems to be built around cultivating this valley for food.  There are also plenty of small fishing docks and equipment on a well traveled trail further down from the village. </p>

<p>We receive sour scowls as greetings. No one came out to meet us and Islanders make an effort to slip away at first chance when confronted. The Islanders here are not happy to see us, but they do not appear armed or hostile. </p>

<p>It is like they have collectively decided to dislike us from the get go, or perhaps the rule of hospitality is very different in this tribe.  Our scouting delegation returns without answers as the Islanders do little but stare or move out of the way. None of the Islander appear to be very willing to speak to us.</p>

<p>I will have to send out an officer to deal with the situation. They all have their own ideas in how move forward.</p>
