<h1>Thousand Islands</h1>
</div>


<div id="story-text">

<p>‘Obelisk’ is a strange and somewhat famous rock formation in the thousand sea. It’s a spire of vaguely square hard rock that point out of the sea, it’s about 3-4 mast lengths in height and has a wider flattened top, making it look like very large nail sticking straight out of the ocean. It is far from any sizable habitable island and is in a place where hazardous shallows are frequent. It would have been a useful landmark had there been anything nearby to sail to. Our travels are taking us past it now and Officer Nyxie is steering us in close to get a closer look at the peculiar namesake.</p>

<p>“Its old.” Nyxie commented. “I wonder what it’s made of, sea and wind should have worn it down long ago like many of the formations you see in Sea of fangs.” </p>

<p>As passed under its shadow, the age of the structure was apparent. It had a slight tilt to it and layers and layers of grime and growth on it. However, some spots, which weathered many hard waves regularly, were clearer than others and those showed that the rock itself was almost flat and unworn underneath. </p>

<p>“I would love to get a sample of that.” Keeper spoke unexpectedly as he slinked up the stairs to our position. “Mostly to sate my curiosity, nothing else. The world contains many strange unexplained wonders. It would be a delight be part of unravelling a small piece of one.” He explained.</p>

<p>“How do you propose to even get close to that safely? There is nowhere to land and the waves are rough around it.” Nyxie frowned. “Too risky for a skiff.” </p>

<p>Keeper pointed to the top of the obelisk, to the flat piece far above. “Perhaps a volunteer could fly up there and then chip off a piece.” </p>

<p>“That’s still a lot of risk for curiosity.” There was little to gain from such an excursion and plenty to loose having someone risk flying up so high.  However, I could assign one of the scouts to do it, or ask for volunteers from able fliers in the crew. Keeper has added he might be willing to offer a reward as incentive to anyone willing to try. My personal flying aptitude is too low to even consider trying.</p>
