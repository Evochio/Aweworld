<h1>Thousand Islands</h1>
</div>


<div id="story-text">

<p>‘Obelisk’ is a strange and somewhat famous rock formation in the thousand sea. It’s a spire of vaguely square hard rock that point out of the sea, it’s about 3-4 mast lengths in height and has a wider flattened top, making it look like very large nail sticking straight out of the ocean. It is far from any sizable habitable island and is in a place where hazardous shallows are frequent. It would have been a useful landmark had there been anything nearby to sail to. Our travels are taking us past it now and Officer Nyxie is steering us in close to get a closer look at the peculiar namesake.</p>

<p>“Its old.” Nyxie commented. “I wonder what it’s made of, sea and wind should have worn it down long ago like many of the formations you see in Sea of fangs.” </p>

<p>As passed under its shadow, the age of the structure was apparent. It had a slight tilt to it and layers and layers of grime and growth on it. However, some spots, which weathered many hard waves regularly, were clearer than others and those showed that the rock itself was almost flat and unworn underneath. </p>

<p>“I would love to get a sample of that.” Keeper spoke unexpectedly as he slinked up the stairs to our position. “Mostly to sate my curiosity, nothing else. The world contains many strange unexplained wonders. It would be a delight be part of unravelling a small piece of one.” He explained.</p>

<p>“How do you propose to even get close to that safely? There is nowhere to land and the waves are rough around it.” Nyxie frowned. “Too risky for a small-boat.” </p>

<p>Keeper pointed to the top of the obelisk, to the flat piece far above. “Perhaps a volunteer could fly up there and then chip off a piece.” </p>

<p>“That’s still a lot of risk for curiosity.” There was little to gain from such an excursion and plenty to loose having someone risk flying up so high.  However, I could assign one of the scouts to do it, or ask for volunteers from able fliers in the crew. Keeper has added he might be willing to offer a reward as incentive to anyone willing to try. My personal flying aptitude is too low to even consider trying.</p>

<div class="scouts hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>I summon Scout-Master Krel and he stands a while with his head raised, peering up at the Obelisk. He no doubt guesses my intentions for summoning him, but says nothing. <br>
“Would it be possible for one or more of your troop to ascend to the peak of this obelisk and collect a sample?” I ask him. Nyxie and Keeper stand beside me. Nyxie looks apologetic while Keeper grins.<br>
“The winds are a bit mellow, but yes, I reckon one of us could.” He rubs his chin. “If that’s your orders Captain.” <br>
“Only if you consider it no undue risk.” I replied.</p>
<p>“There are always risks to flight, especially at open sea. This should be manageable. Landing might be tricky.” The Scout-Master nodded and shrugged off his cloak. <br>
To my surprise, he goes at it alone. First he climbs up the mast to the crows-nest and then he waits for a good wind and takes off from there. His underlings watch from the deck in silence as he circles around, looking for winds and updrafts to climb higher without wasting too much energy. It’s a rare Awe that can do it well enough that they’re not wasting more energy staying airborne like that then flapping their way to the goal.</p>
</div>

<div class="volunteer hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>“What kind of reward are you considering to give Keeper?” I quirk my head at the Wulf. <br>
“Oh… I suppose I could take special requests from an eventual winner, within reason. Or ‘limited’ access to my personal stash of delicious goodies.” Keepers tail twirled around as he considered the manner. I shrugged, it was a good idea as any. It didn’t feel right to order the scouts to exert themselves over a mere curiosity. <br>
“Put a request out for volunteers who wish to give it a try and win a reward. Don’t accept just anyone, I’d rather not be rowing out any small-boats to do rescues.” I say, deciding to make it a bit of an event. <br>
Soon enough, the word goes out. Many volunteered, Awes with something to prove or otherwise just looking to skirt their way out of their current shifts. I did not let all of them try. Only those with high enough flight-aptitude scores. <br>
That narrowed it down to a 9 or so Awes, all but 2 of them male, who were soon circling the sky above the boat. Among them, is Cadet Valnos, with the other two cadets cheering him on. None of the scouts volunteered.</p>
</div>

<div class="skip hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>I choose not to risk any of our capable Awes over a whim and a little bit of curiosity. This obelisk seems to have stood here for untold ages, built by people from a bygone era and it will no doubt stand longer still. Let others with better equipment and time investigate it. <br>
I can't help but wonder how and why they built it out to sea and how much taller this spire truly is, the waters around here are quite deep. It makes sense to think perhaps there was no sea here then, but that in itself is a frightening idea. <br>
As we put distance to the obelisk and the setting sun dims on the horizon, it seems almost like there a faint glow to the obelisks peak. But as darkness falls further, no such light is visible further visible.</p>
</div>

<div class="scouts2 hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly Scout-Master Krel makes it to the top of the Obelisk without complications. He disappears from view as he lands up there. <br>
He is gone a while, it must be quite hard to chisel a piece loose. Then he appears again, making a quick but controlled descent. <br>
As he lands he has a look of consternation upon his face that’s quite unusual for his person. <br>
“Captain. There is a person up there, a strange Gator.” He says. <br>
“A gator?! Up there? How did they get up there?” I look up and narrow my eyes. I see no way of climbing this obelisk. <br>
“They looks unusual and I can’t understand a word they’re saying. He was not speaking ‘Core’ as I understood it.” <br>
“Perhaps a dialect of it, there are quite many in the Empire.” Offered Keeper. <br>
“They did not have any climbing gear or anything much but a small pack of papers and coals. They could be a look-out spy, but seemed quite relieved to see me.” Scout-Master Krel continued. <br>
“How do we get them down to the ship?” I asked. <br>
Everyone looked up at the peak. There was no clear answers.</p>
</div>

<div class="volunteer2 hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>There are some drop-outs early. Some of the volunteers seem like they never had it in them to take the long flight and like they just wanted an excuse for exercise. <br>
At least they did not drop into the sea. I think I had taken my time about ordering rescue for them. <br>
One Awe tried flapping his way to the peak in a straight line. But he tired long before he reached the top and had to abort and glide back to the ship, panting as he came. <br>
The other Awes were doing much better, 5 Awes circling in a flock following the same winds and updrafts. Among them were Cadet Valnos. <br>
I am surprised he had such a high flight aptitude. It’s on his records, sure. He just didn't seem the type to have the courage. Curiosity must be a powerful force, that or the promise of Keepers ‘goodies’.<br>
<div class="fail hidden">
It was a commendable effort from all of the final volunteers. It seemed they were circling near the top of the Obelisk quite a while, but not quite up there. I see one Awe swoop in to attempt to land, flapping hard to gain the bit of missing extra height, but they don’t quite make it and abort. <br>
One by one they veer off and descend hard back toward the ship. Valnos among them. <br>
It seems no one managed to get there, the disappointment among the crew who had gathered to watch (and no doubt make bets) was palpable. But no one held it against the Awes who returned, who received pats on their shoulders and backs and compliments on good effort. <br>
Though we failed to get an Awe to the summit of the Obelisk, the crew was cheered by the sport of trying.<br>
Perhaps the Obelisk is best left undisturbed.</p>
</div>
<div class="success hidden">

I see one Awe swoop in to attempt to land, flapping hard to gain the bit of missing extra height, but they don’t quite make it and abort. <br>
Then another one tries, I can’t make out who it is, but judging by the excitement from Cadet Ziggy, it must be Valnos. He disappears from view and the crew holds their breath. <br>
 Then cheers erupt as he does not emerge again and the other flying Awes start to turn away and descend. It seems he made it!</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="volunteer3 hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Cadet Valnos is up there a while. No doubt chiseling out a piece of the obelisk. <br>
He soon emerges and descends with haste toward the ship, almost coming in a little too hard as he nearly overshoot due to his speed. <br>
His breath is heavy and his wings are noticeably shuddering from effort as he hurries up to deliver his report. <br>
“Cap… captain.” He salutes. <br>
“Catch your breath Cadet.” I tell him calmly. <br>
“Yes… sorry. But… There is someone up there. On the Obelisk!” Valnos squeaked. <br>
I exchange some surprised glances with my fellow gathered officers, Nyxie and Keeper. My first officer steps closer to listen too. <br>
“Explain, who’s up there?” I urge him to continue. <br>
“It’s some kind of Gator. Strange one. Kind of friendly. Could not understand them though, didn’t sound like ‘Core’ either.” Valnos was catching his breath now, the words falling out of him fast. <br>
“Perhaps a dialect of Core, there are many in the Empire.” Officer Keeper offered. <br>
“How did they get up there?” I asked. <br>
Valnos just shook his head. “I don’t know, they hardly seemed to have any gear.”<br>
“Well… how do we get them down?” I crossed my arms. <br>
Everyone looked up at the peak. There was no clear answers.</p>

<div class="decision2 hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>I listen to the suggestions of my assembled officers. <br>
Just as I am about to make my decision on the course of action, someone calls out. <br>
“They jumped!” <br>
Everyone turns to look at a lone figure plummeting down from the great height of the Obelisk peak. Before with a giant ‘SPLOOSH’, crashing into the sea not too far from the base of it. <br>
“Welp, so much for that mystery.” Keeper muttered. <br>
Waves break against the base of the obelisk violently, but the strange Gator is not visible anywhere. Then Officer Nyxie, sharp-eyed as ever, points and shouts. <br>
“There, paddling among the waves!” <br>
Indeed, a figure was struggling in the water, seeming to have survived the fall somehow, but perhaps not unscathed. They seemed to barely be able to hold their head above water. <br>
“Get the boat, pick them up.” I ordered. The crew hurried to obey.</p>
</div>

<div class="stranger hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>The strange gator is brought onto the ship and many of the grew gather to ogle at them as they struggle to climb aboard. <br>
Somehow when I received the report of a mysterious gator at the peak of the Obelisk, I had imagined some mythical figure, like a risen Gator warlord of old. This figure however was the least threatening looking Gator i’ve seen. Of strange coloration, quite dumpy for a gator and plump. <br>
“Where do you think he comes from? He’s unlike any Gator I’ve seen.” Nyxie cocked her head at him as we stood arrayed, watching the gator pant and huff from the exertion of climbing aboard. <br>
“The Empire is larger than you can imagine, stretches far west inland to places where they only hear about places like the sea in tales of legend.” Keeper explained. “Perhaps he’s a far traveler from there.” <br>
The figure spoke then. A babble of nonsense no one understood with plenty of gesticulation. From his pack he produced a sheet of wet paper, filled with sketches. On the top one, a bit mussed up but visible, was one of our ship, viewed from the vantage of the obelisk. <br>
“Look, he really must be a look-out of some kind! He’s sketched our ship.” Scout-Master Krel narrowed his eyes. <br>
“A spy, how interesting! Imagine the places you can find them at.” Officer Keeper moved to take the stack of moist papers. The Gator resisted him at first, making noises, but a couple of weapons being directed at him made him let go. <br>
<div class="scout2 hidden">
“Ah look, see, he’s drawn Scout-Master Krel already!” Keeper showed a page, the most recent drawing. It was quite a accurate depiction Krel with a suspicious face, he wore just the likeness as I turned to him. <br>
</div>
<div class="success hidden">
“Ah look, see, he’s drawn Cadet Valnos already!” Keeper showed a page, the most recent drawing. It was quite an accurate depiction of Valnos looking nervous. He wore just the likeness as I turned to him. <br>
</div>
“What should we do with him Captain?” My First-Officer huffed, everyone was now eyeing the stranger with quite a bit more suspicion. The strange gator seemed not to notice, just trying to say something again. He had a scent about him that seemed to put me on edge. For the lack of better terms, it was.. mouthwatering. <br>
“I could try puzzle out his dialect Captain.” Officer Nyxie surprisingly offered. “He is a bit unusual, I can't put my paw on it, but something about it sounds familiar.”</p>

<p>I was not so sure keeping a unknown spy around was wise. I could take Nyxies offer to glean information from him. But otherwise, he was best served for the kitchens. Let him spy on the bellies of the crew.</p>

</div>

<div class="kitchen hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>The Gator spy is led a long below deck. Wherever he goes, heads turn to watch him, nostrils flare with interest. The more I consider it, the more i'm certain, there really is nothing else to do with him but serve him up for the crew. <br>
His presence has made me think about how many other potential spies might be lurking around Thousand Isles in the most unexpected of places. At least we have one less to worry about now. <br>
Come late evening, the delicious scent of cooking permeates the ship. I reckon chef Zat rarely gets so fresh and delectable ingredients so he has put a lot of energy into this meal. <br>
The stew is excellent and it brings out the crew in droves to the mess hall and puts the crew in high spirits. I admit to using captains privileges a little to get myself severals helpings myself. <br>
I make a note of being extra perceptive in the future for these types of Gators. They will always be welcome to my galley. <br>
I find Keeper later on and he’s been going through the sketches of the spy. He seems uncharacteristically stumped by them, explaining that beside drawing of sea and islands there are also some of strange places, people and contraptions. The world truly is vast and mysterious.</p>
</div>

<div class="nyxie hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Nyxie leads the captive spy away, holding him firmly by the arm. She was never a very martial Awe, but even she can handle this meek Gator. <br>
Still, knowing he survived a fall from the top of the obelisk, I put some guards to her service should she need it. <br>
We depart the obelisk as the skies darken to night. I can't help but wonder how and why they built it out to sea and how much taller this spire truly is, the waters around here are quite deep. It makes sense to think perhaps there was no sea here then, but that in itself is a frightening idea. <br>
I receive news of Nyxies progress the morning after. But it's not the kind I had expected. <br></p>
</div>

<div class="nyxie2 hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>
“I am sorry Captain, I… just couldn't help myself. I spent all evening with him, making no progress. He just smelled so good so I decided to just give him a little nibble you know… then… one thing led to another and… well.” Nyxie gazed down at her portlier figure with a mixture of embarrassment and consternation. <br>
“Well… you certainly put on a great deal from him. Hmph… Do you feel alright?” I ask the Navigational officer. <br>
“Oh, yes, I do. I feel pretty good in fact! Just a little bit sluggish you know.” She beamed and smiled. She was still the same old Nyxie I think, just a little bigger. <br>
“Very well… I won't hold it against you. I was considering the same alternative anyway.” I nodded and dismissed her. <br>
“Okay! Did they serve breakfast already?” She wandered off. <br>
I find Keeper later on and he’s been going through the sketches of the spy. He seems uncharacteristically stumped by them, explaining that beside drawing of sea and islands there are also some of strange places, people and contraptions. The world truly is vast and mysterious.</p>
