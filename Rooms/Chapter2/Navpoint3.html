<h1>Thousand Islands</h1>
</div>


<div id="story-text">

<p>We sail deeper into Thousand Islands and the islands start to become more numerous. There's at least always one or two visible on the horizon somewhere at this point, but as we get deeper they can in places become almost a maze-like archipelago.</p>

<p>Navigating this sea with this many landmarks is at least easy as long as we keep track of where we are. Finding our way again if the weather throws us off with so many similar looking lone islands around would set us back considerably.</p>

<p>Luckily the weather has remained relatively calm, with only small bouts of sudden squalls as temperature drops for the evenings. Nothing the crew and ship cant handle with seemingly trivial ease. I still catch myself occasionally worried sometimes, only to remember I'm no longer on my old ship 'Barristan' of the East sea.</p>

<p>The island Scout Harbinger marked out turns out to be a sizable stretch of thin flat landmass. Its high enough above sea-level provide refuge to tides but have little in terms of high cliffs.</p>

<p>Still, it seems thickly forested and dense with brush. Its clearly the home of many birds as their squawking is heard well off the coast as we search for a suitable approach. </p>

<p>The shores around the island are shallow all the way around and we have to settle further out then I'd like. The ship will be blown around by wind and wave. </p>

<div class="investigate hidden"><p><strong>Investigate</strong></p>
<p>So far no sign of the supposed scout. But if they are here they might just be on the wrong side of the island so I'm not ready to make any assumptions yet. The scouts have reported some fleeting signs of habitation, but I have a hard time seeing how any natives could live here.</p>

<p>Due to the difficulty of landing boats in, I can only send out a limited shore party. I'll have to decide on who to send with the assignment to search.</p>

<p>Arn, Tung or Garsch </p>
</div>

<div class="scout hidden"><p><strong>Scout Report</strong></p>
<p>The scouts report the island is twice as long as its wide in a vague crescent shape. Its covered by forest all through-out, in some places all the way to the shoreline. It may in fact be that the island proper is actually smaller then it seems as a form of mangrove grows along its edges and over the shallow water itself. </p>

<p>There are a few landing spots boats where mangrove isn't too thick, but they involve some cliff climbing. </p>

<p>There appears to be smoke of what could be cooking fires coming from the center of the island. However there are little to no visible open areas not covered by canopy of trees.</p>

<p>The scouts are unable to penetrate deep into the forest proper without making a proper expedition out of it. </p>
</div>

<div class="mission hidden"><p><strong>Expedition result</strong></p>
<p>The expedition paddles away and beach their boats on the cliffs and disappear into the brush of island. I can faintly hear them call out in Awe greeting-call even from here, but its soon drowned out as they move further in. We can do little back at the ship and wait. Hopefully they will be back before nightfall or we'll have to keep a signal flame alight.</p>

<p>Success:</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The party has come in contact with a small village of Gryph Islanders and our wayward scout who seemed to be living among them. They have brought the Scout with them along with a few Islanders who arrive with canoes from somewhere hidden of the island thick mangrove brush.</p>

<p>Soon the missing Scout stands on deck along with a two Gryphs. One elaborately painted and one less decorated but solid and strong looking. Islander Gryphs were notably a lot bulkier then the Kingdom variant.</p>

<p>Fail:</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>The expedition returns empty-handed and looking flustered and annoyed. The thick forest proved difficult too difficult to navigate and whats more there seemed to be several traps around which hindered of slowed the party down. As darkness began to fall, they turned back toward the ship.</p>

<p>But our presence has not gone unnoticed. We spot canoes warily paddling among the mangrove brush, observing our ship. Perhaps they will come to us instead. </p>
</div>
<div class="talks hidden"><p><strong>Scout Vessla</strong></p>
<p>Scout Vessla is a bushy furred and older scout then I'm used to seeing. He's carrying painted markings and garments like those the islanders have. It seems he had been integrating quite well with them. </p>

<p>There's a slight unmistakable air of distance in him toward us, he stands firmly with the islanders and does not quite seem to be hopping with joy to me back among his own kind. </p>

<p>“Scout Vessla reporting as requested.” He muttered brusquely and stood at attention as I approached.</p>

<p>“Im Captain Avolc of the Attentive.” I turn my gaze toward the islanders and Scout Vessla motions as he introduces them.</p>

<p>“This is Forager Holixer and Chief-Son Darter.” The scout switches to Trade-tongue, the language of the kingdom and the common language used in the west. I note how he introduced the larger 'Forager' before what I assume is the smaller but more elaborately painted supposed son of the chieftain.</p>

<p>I extend a wing to touch the Foragers before the Chief-sons.</p>

<p>“Fortuitous greetings.” I greet them neutrally but pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Honored Leader.” Forager Holixer curtsies with a bow of his head along with Chief-Son Darter, who remains silent.</p>

<p>“What brings you to Lanaga territory, Captain?” Scout Vessla asks absently. I frown at him, normal procedure would be to report for duty, he's clearly keeping a distance.</p>

<p>“I was told I could find you here, you were left on assignment by the Fleet. A Fleet I'm trying to come in contact with. I'd like your report and aid in locating their whereabouts, Scout.”</p>

<p>Scout Harbinger stands not far out of view and Vessla meets his eyes briefly before nodding.</p>

<p>“The Fleet-Admiral left me here to negotiate the Lanaga tribes future cooperation with Admiralty operations in the area. They lay claim to this area of sea and its resources as their foraging grounds.” The scout explains.</p>

<p>I quirk my brow at this. It was not what I heard from Scout Harbinger.</p>

<p>“Oh? You received such additional instructions were you to make contact with the natives?” I switch to Awe tongue. “I don't believe Admiralty officially recognizes any claim to these islands.”</p>

<p>This seems to test Scout Vessla who knits his brow eyes me sternly.</p>

<p>“Captain! My orders were to make contact, yes. But during my time here I've learned much of their customs and society. They may not be a recognized nation, but they have ancestral claim to this region of sea and we'd do well to respect them if we want future naval operations to remain peaceful.”</p>

<p>His defensiveness and tone is a little sudden, the Gryphs shift uncomfortably at the clipped anger in his tone, though they don't seem to understand the Aweish words. It seems he had gotten quite attached to his hosts and perhaps them to him.</p>

<p>“Lower your hackles Scout.” I warn him. “I'm not here to make policy or drive anyone off their islands. You better explain where this attitude is coming from, I have no patience for subtleties.”</p>

<p>The scout seems to visible force himself to calm and meets my eyes.</p>

<p>“Alright Captain. I will explain, in private, if that's okay.”</p>

<p>I motion toward my cabin to where we can have a debriefing. To my surprise, the two Gryphs follow in the Scouts steps before I can say anything else. </p>

</div>

<div class="talks2 hidden"><p><strong>Scout Vessla</strong></p>
<p>Once seated I steeple my paws together and observe the way the Chief-son seats himself close to the Scout. They have an unmistakable tender sort of familiarity with each-other. I stow that observation away for later. </p>

<p>“So. Scout Vessla, why don't you begin from the beginning.” I Offer in Trade-speech for the benefit of our guests.</p>

<p>“We spotted the Lanagans during our movement through the area. The Fleet-Admiral had hoped to gain some local information about the force opposing us most of all. But they proved elusive to our efforts for contact and I volunteered to stay and gather information.”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems you were successful in your efforts, the Fleet-Admiral will be pleased once we find them.” I nod toward the Gryphs. To my surprise Forager Holixer speaks up with a firm tone and hard stare.</p>

<p>“Vessla has joined tribe Lanaga. Only his 'report' need return, not his person.”</p>

<p>I pause at this, incredulous and turn to Vessla for some sort of explanation, but he remains silent, avoiding eye contact.</p>

<p>“Am I to understand Vessla is your prisoner?” Yet as I ask this, it makes little sense for them to be here on my ship, just the three of them if this was the case.</p>

<p>“No. Vessla is no prisoner. He is now Lanaga.” He continues with his burly croaking voice, the Chief-son meanwhile straightens, raising his crest with confidence and challenge while the Forager speaks for him. “We are here to ensure his wishes are heard and he not be taken away against his will.”</p>

<p>I find myself briefly at a loss for words and eye them back and forth, but they seemed entirely straight-faced serious. Even as I struggle at what end to grip this unexpected twist of an issue, Vessla noticeably inches closer to Darter.</p>

<p>“I'm not sure I understand. You joined the Islanders?” I find myself asking in Aweish.</p>

<p>“I did! They were very hospitable once they got over their initial suspicion of me. I came to appreciate their ways and way of life.” He eyed the Red and yellow feathered Gryph who smiled back at him. “I wish to stay.”</p>

<p>I suspected there was more going on then was being said. In truth it was not my business.</p>

<p>But what gives me strongest pause is the scouts abandonment of his sworn enlisted duties. One can not just decide to quit and go native somewhere. We Awes enter a contract when we volunteer to serve, we are trained, housed and fed and in return we protect our society, our home.</p>

<p>They fear I have come to reject his decision and drag him back to his duties. And as his superior, I have every right to do this, by Admiralty law. </p>

</div>

<div class="letgo hidden"><p><strong>Let him go</strong></p>
<p>There's no point forcing someone into service. If their loyalty is elsewhere, they cant fully be trusted to perform their duties. </p>

<p>I find myself letting out a deep sigh. The trio have patiently waited for me to finish considering their words.</p>

<p>“I want a full report and as much intelligence you can muster, Scout Vessla. When we leave here without you there should be nothing useful in your mind thats not in a report. You hear me?” I speak slowly in Trade-Tongue.</p>

<p>Vessla seems to beam and relaxes visibly with relief. Darter emits a coo and chirp and Forager Holixer nods in a pleased manner of agreement.</p>

<p>“Honored Leader, your generosity will not be forgotten by Lanaga tribe! Awe will be true friend of the isles. May there be union of winged fur and feather, we shall accept all Awe who wish be Lanaga.” Darter spoke up for the first time, his voice almost musical.</p>

<p>Committed to the decision I feel its best to take advantage to the positives it might bring.</p>

<p>“Awes likewise accept any Islander who'd wish to align their cause with ours.” I venture carefully. Darter accepts it with a courteous nod.</p>

<p>Out meeting is finished and Vessla is put to work writing down his gained knowledge of the Isles and the Lanagas.</p>

<p>Chief-Son Darter meanwhile has invited me and the ships crew over for a night of festivity with their tribe on the island as guests. </p>

<p>But I have politely turned him down as kindly as I could. We are as pressed as ever for time and though I didn't say as much, I did not wish for any other of the crew to get seduced into any bright ideas. </p>
</div>

<div class="negotiate hidden"><p><strong>Negotiate</strong></p>
<p>“I must object.” I straighten firmly in my seat and eye each of them in turn. “You still have your duty to the Admiralty.”</p>

<p>“But Captain! This isn't just about me, its a great opportunity to further a relationship between the peoples of the Isles and Aweland. Whats... whats one Awe here and there, you can do without me!”</p>

<p>Whatever his relationship with the Islanders, I get a sense he more seems to fear returning rather then leaving. I have chance to reason this over peacefully.</p>
</div>

</body>
<div class="question hidden"><p><strong>Question his Fear</strong></p>
<p>“There's more to this then you are letting on Vessla. I'm not going to question your affection for these people, but it sounds to me like there is more keeping you away then to stay.” I switch to Aweish again. Much to the seeming annoyance of the two Gryph guests. But they say nothing except ruffle their plumage lightly. Vessla seems to hesitate, but my piercing gaze and words seems to hit home. </p>

<p>“I assume you were in the first skirmish with the hostile force. Did the thunder-weapons scare you that much?” </p>

<p>“I... No, you don't understand. Its... just. The Fleet-Admiral, she's... ” He seems to look for words. “Driven. Beyond driven. She's a force of nature Captain. The weapons scared me, of course, they did everyone. But not her!”</p>

<p>I cock my head at this, wondering what he's getting at.</p>

<p>“This doesn't sound like a thing to run away from. A strong leader to rally under is ideal under such circumstances, no?” </p>

<p>“Yes... but. You haven't met her Captain. I... felt like I was being swept away in a vengeful avalanche and had to pull myself to safety before it reached the precipice! She will stop at nothing, its victory or doom.”</p>

<p>I sigh and shake my head. I know the Fleet-Admiral has a reputation for being a tough fluff, even in her Matron age. Still, thats no valid reason for this “flight”. I let him know as much.</p>

<p>“Surely you understand that this is not good enough a reason for me to accept.” </p>

<p>“Accept it or not, this is the choice I have made and wish you'll respect Captain.” Vessla snaps in Trade-Tongue. The two Gryphs shift closer to him defensively. They had not understood most of the exchange but stand with their tribesman. Too much argument and they are likely to break off these talks and leave me with fewer harder choices. </p>

</div>

<div class="shame hidden"><p><strong>Shame</strong></p>
<p>“Listen to yourself Scout. This is all highly irresponsible to your duty, to your people!” I scold in Trade-Tongue. The Gryphs are a party to this. </p>

<p>“This is a time of crisis for our people. Our homeland was attacked and there are clear foes opposing us here in these seas. The Lanaga are clearly not one of them and that is good, but you'd rather hide among them then do what you are sworn and trained to do!” I give them all a tough glare and disgruntled frown.</p>

<p>Forager Holixer most of all seems to shift uncomfortably to the accusations, even if they're not directed at him. </p>

<p>“But Captain... I've served the Admiralty for many years! This is my third and final rotation, I'm not far from... retirement.” Even as he says it his voice wavers, realizing his own trap.</p>

<p>“Thats right. You are still in rotation, no matter how you feel about it.” I cross my arms firmly but lower my voice. “Or does the Lanaga tribe not welcome back those who return from defending their 'tribe' of birth?”</p>

<p>Forager Holixer straightens his crest and crawks. “Lanagara always welcomes back their own.” He turns aside to eye Darter and Vessla. “We protect our own, our family. Our home-isles.”</p>

<p>It seems I won points with all of them. </p>
</div>
<div class="threaten hidden"><p><strong>Threaten</strong></p>
<p>“Scout Vessla, I'm sure I don't have to tell you what the law for desertion is.” Before he can answer I give a hard slap to the gut under my belt without breaking my gaze with him.</p>

<p>Vessla visibly gulps nervously, but Forager Holixer seems to straighten and clack his beak briefly, coming to the scouts defense. “Threats are not to be made lightly Awe-Captain!”</p>

<p>“Scout Vessla abandoning his duty at this point would hurt our cause with more then just his absence. It sets a dangerous precedent that threaten the crews conviction and dedication.” I slammed a clenched paw on the table. “You are here for the defense of the homeland! Not to find a place of refuge! So I can only offer him the ONE way out everyone else gets. And I assure you there will be very little lightness about me if you interfere and force me to fit all three of you!”</p>

<p>They seemed to take my threat quite seriously. Shifting uncertainly, but the Chief-son Darter looked noticeably agitated.</p>

</div>
<div class="failed hidden"><p><strong>Failed Negotiation</strong></p>
<p>The Gryphs have had enough. Chief-son Darter rises from his seat, clacking at the floor with his claws. It seems he has lost patience with these discussions.</p>

<p>“Points of view have been exchanged. But now I have heard enough and ask you to depart and leave me and mine in peace.” The Gryph places an arm around Vessla firmly and possessively. “I was told you Awes are honorable and reasonable. I trust there will be no contention and conflict.”</p>

<p>Forager Holixer rises along with the Chief-son. I've puzzled together that he is the protector of the Tribe-Prince and no doubt of some authority, he appears more torn but he offers no argument and stands with Darter. </p>
</div>

<div class="apprehend hidden"><p><strong>Apprehend Vessla</strong></p>
<p>“You are free to leave.” I tell the two Gryphs. But then nod toward the Scout firmly. </p>

<p>“But Scout Vessla is staying with us. Willing or not, I will not permit him to desert his duty until released from service. I'm sorry if this will cause issue between us, but we at the Admiralty take responsibility seriously.”</p>

<p>Guards who had been standing outside step into the room, swords sheathed but at their sides. A Raptorian looms in the corridor outside. Its an unfortunate precaution and show of force I had hoped it would not have come to.</p>

<p>Both the Gryphs visibly tense and plumage rises in outrage. But before anything escalates further Vessla calls out.</p>

<p>“Wait! There's no need for violence! I will submit. I will fall in line, just nobody needs to get hurt.”</p>

<p>I nod firmly and the tension drains out of the room. It seems Scout Vessla has some reason in him after all. But Chief-Son Darter looks extremely displeased by our heavy-handedness, even as I offer an olive branch as we part ways and they leave the ship for their canoes.</p>

<p>“Scout Vessla will be allowed to return once his service is completed. If things go well in our anti-pirating efforts around these seas, that might be sooner then you think.”</p>

<p>“The Lanaga will remember the way you shackle your own to duty. We shall be careful in our deals with you.”</p>
