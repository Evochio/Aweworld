<div id="story-text">

<p>We sail deeper into Thousand Islands and the islands start to become more numerous. There's at least always one or two visible on the horizon somewhere at this point, but as we get deeper they can in places become almost a maze-like archipelago.</p>

<p>Navigating this sea with this many landmarks is at least easy as long as we keep track of where we are. Finding our way again if the weather throws us off with so many similar looking lone islands around would set us back considerably.</p>

<p>Luckily the weather has remained relatively calm, with only small bouts of sudden squalls as temperature drops for the evenings. Nothing the crew and ship cant handle with seemingly trivial ease. I still catch myself occasionally worried sometimes, only to remember I'm no longer on my old ship 'Barristan' of the East sea. I wonder how my old crew is doing.</p>

<p>The island Scout Harbinger marked out turns out to be a sizable stretch of thin flat landmass. Its high enough above sea-level to provide refuge against tides but aside from the occasional treacherous looking cliffy stretch of shore its a rather flat island.</p>

<p>Still, its thickly forested and dense with brush. Its clearly the home of many birds as their squawking is heard well off the coast as we search for a suitable approach. </p>

<p>The shores around the island are shallow all the way around and we have to settle further out then I'd like. The ship will be blown around by wind and wave. </p>

<div class="investigate hidden"><p><strong>Investigate</strong></p>
<p>So far no sign of the supposed scout. But if they are here they might just be on the wrong side of the island so I'm not ready to make any assumptions yet. If scouts had not reported some fleeting signs of habitation, I would have had a hard time seeing how any natives could live here. There seems to be no visible easy entry to the island.</p>

<p>Due to the difficulty of landing boats in, I can only send out a limited shore party. I'll have to decide on what kind of approach to take and who to send give the assignment.</p>

<div class="scout hidden"><p><strong>Scout Report</strong></p>
<p>The scouts report the island is twice as long as its wide in a vague crescent shape. Its covered by forest all through-out, in some places all the way to the shoreline and beyond with roots and mangroves. It may in fact be that the island proper is actually smaller then it seems as the mangrove grows all along its edges. </p>

<p>There are a few landing spots boats where mangrove isn't too thick, but they involve some cliff climbing. </p>

<p>(Scouts bonus): There appears to be smoke of what could be cooking fires coming from the center of the island. However there are little to no visible open areas not covered by canopy of trees.</p>

<p>The scouts are unable to penetrate deep into the forest proper without making a proper expedition out of it. </p>
</div>

<div class="mission hidden"><p><strong>Expedition</strong></p>
<div class="garschText hidden">
<p>Garsches heavily armed expedition paddles away and beach their boats on the cliffs and disappear into the brush of island. Whatever they'll face I have no doubt the old grizzled Arms-Officer can handle, he even brought a Raptorian along, probably to help make a path through the woods. I can faintly hear them call out in Awe greeting-call even from here, but its soon muffled as they move further into the dense greenery of the island. We can do little back at the ship but wait. Hopefully they will be back before nightfall or we'll have to keep a signal flame alight.</p>

<p>I have the Raptorian pack on standby should there be any alert. </p>
</div>
<div class="nyxieText hidden">
<p>Nyxies team of specialists paddle away and then start to slowly circle the shallow coastline. I can hear them call out in Awe greeting-call now and then, but they seem focused on their task in finding some kind of break in the dense groves which grow well out into the waters. They soon round the bend of the island and we can do little back at the ship but wait. Hopefully they will be back before nightfall or we'll have to keep a signal flame alight.</p>

<p>I have the Scouts and an extra crew on boat on standby should there be any alert. But Nyxie is a very bright Officer, there should be no cause for worry.</p>
</div>
<div class="keeperText hidden">
<p>Under Keepers instructions; torches, not lanterns, are lit along the deck of the ship, lighting us up for all to see clearly. He also has a brazier set to blaze on the foredeck, all this much to Officers Tick vehement dismay of so much overt use of open flame.</p>
<p>He is about to instruct Chef Zat to slaughter some of our live foodstock and set some meats roasting when I decide to put my foot down. Im onboard for his idea for making an inviting atmosphere, but we are not throwing a feast with our supplies limited as they are. </p>
<p>"Those supplies are from our resupply cargo, they are meant for the fleet once we rendezvous with them." I said.</p> 
<p>"I am the logistics officer, dear Captain. I am well aware of our supply situation and intention. Its nothing a little possible extra foraging couldnt replace!" He said slyly. <br />
"I cant go and offer them dried ships rations, its a feast or no feast, lest we make insult. Besides, a good meal and hospitality will relax them and open them up for more conversation."</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="feast2 hidden">
<p>With some reluctance I permit Keeper to prepare a feast from our more choice goods. <br />
This puts a dent in some of the supplies we were carrying meant for the fleet, mostly the choice meats out of the officer rations. <br />
Hopefully they won't be missed, i'm not as confident they'll be as easy to replace as Keeper states. <br />
</p>
</div>

<div class="nofeast hidden">
<p>Keeper and our potential guests will have to contend with an inviting atmosphere and some light appetizers as nibbles. <br />
We're here for a purpose not to invite a whole Island tribe to eat up our foodstocks. <br />
Officer Keeper does not seem too bothered by my decision, he gave a non-committed shrug and sent word down for Chef Zat to put the foodstores back.</p>
</div>


<div class="mission2 hidden"><p><strong>Expedition result</strong></p>
<div class="garschText hidden">
<p>Officer Garsch team is swift. After a hour or so they return to the edge of the forest and signal 'all okay'. They soon paddle back to the ship, though they seem to be empty handed. </p>

<p>Garsch soon reports personally. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Contact was made Captain, we found their little village and the Scout too. But he refused to return with us, both scout and villagers did not take it too well when I insisted he report to you.&rdquo; Garsch scratched his scar idly. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he captive?&rdquo; I asked. </p>

<p>&ldquo;No Captain, it did not look like it. He looked more like he'd made himself comfortable. The village chief bid you welcome to stop by and have further talks. I could have forced the issue and got him out as there were but 2 dozen villagers or so, but left it at that instead of further escalating the situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I crossed my arms and huffed, displeased. Not so much at my officer but at the complication. What was the scout up to? Had he gone native? I was at least glad Officer Garsch had indeed seen sense not to turn things violent and told him as much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well done for now Officer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Either way, it seemed we had to either pay them a visit, on their terms unfortunately. Or we can decline and consider some more rougher hard-lined approaches, do things on our terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="nyxieText hidden">
<p>Nyxies boat comes paddling but a few hours later, just as things were starting to get dark. </p>

<p>The Officer nimbly climbs back aboard ship and salutes for me with her ever cheerful demeanor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain! We found a gap in the undergrowth that the Islanders were using as a passage way for their canoes and made contact with the natives. They were quite surprised to see us!&rdquo; She gave a mirthful chuckle before continuing. </p>

<p>&ldquo;It went peacefully enough however, we made it to the village and had a chat with the Chief and the Scout. He seemed fine, was even dressed as them! Said he didn't want to go however and that he'd like to continue his mission as a liaison to the Islanders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That goes beyond his mission parameters as far as Scout Harbringer told us. He was only here to establish contact and start talks.&rdquo; I frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought as much too and implied that, but he was pretty firm about staying. They did invite you over to break bread and more conversation about it however. They seemed peaceful and nice and there's not terribly many of them. This must be a minor satellite village of sorts. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well done Nyxie, thanks for the information.&rdquo; I dismissed her with a pat on her shoulder. </p>

<p>What was the scout up to? Had he gone native? Either way, it seemed we had to pay them a visit, on their terms unfortunately.</p>

<p>Or we can decline and consider some more hard-lined approaches and do things on our terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="keeperText hidden">
<p>We wait aboard the ship with our eyes toward the island. As one hour passes into another I'm starting to have doubts about this plan. Keeper however urges patience with a smile and cheery manner while he flicks his striped prehensile tail about as he paces along the ship, making us look as welcoming as possible.  One can never be sure about Wulfs, but I'd almost bet he was nervous and having some doubts himself. </p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rdquo; A look-out soon cries out. </p>

<p>Several canoes emerge from somewhere hidden among the thick mangrove brush, carrying Islanders with them who warily paddle closer. Among them, in the leading canoe is our wayward Scout. </p>

<p>Soon the formerly missing Scout stands on deck along with two Gryphs. One elaborately painted and one less decorated but solid and strong looking. Islander Gryphs were notably a lot bulkier then the lithe Kingdom variant.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="decline hidden">
<p>I decide to decline the invitation.  I do not like going to the village on their terms. Its not so much the safety aspect of it as it has to do with respect for orders.  The Scouts refusal to report to the ship are in line with desertion. Scouts are a disciplined bunch, trained from youth, so its quite perplexing.  I can decide he's not worth the effort and risks, or send a troop to arrest him. </p>
<div class="garschText hidden">
<p>Garsch made a path, albeit difficult one, through the dense vegetation to the village. He can make it again, but it will only fit a small force.</p>
</div>
<div class="nyxieText hidden">
<p>Nyxie found a favorable landing spot, so sending in a sizable party to do so would not be difficult. </p>
</div>
<p>A third option I've considered is sending the scout-master and his team to retrieve him. It has risk, but they should be able to do it quickly and quietly. Its part of their training and field of operation.</p>
</div>

<div class="leave hidden">
<p>Its too much trouble then its worth for one scout, valuable as they are, to risking the health of my crew or aggravating conflict with natives.  I'm putting an official report on that Scout 'Vessla' has refused direct command to report to duty and is suspected of desertion.  Our only option is to return to our previous search pattern and likely route of the fleet with what clues we have.</p>
</div>

<div class="kidnap hidden">
<p>Scout-Master Krel was briefed on the mission. He apparently had no reservations about my orders for his troop to infiltrate and capture one of their own, for he raised no comment about it and merely nodded and asked if I wanted it done immediately or later at night.  I left it to his discretion and he decided to wait until night.</p>

<p>It was a tense wait through the night. I decided to stay up and watch for their return.  Scouts are renowned for their skill at silence and subtlety, few appreciate or perhaps realize the depth of their training. Its with this in mind my concern lies, as their target is equally trained and might prove a challenge that is aware of their methods. </p>

<p>Just as dusk is brightening the horizon a cadre of shadows swoop in low over the canopy and toward the ship. Supported between them they carry a tied up bundle which reveal itself to be their captured quarry.  &ldquo;Scout Vessla has been retrieved successfully Captain.&rdquo; The Scout-Master announces briskly upon landing.  I nod approvingly and touch his shoulder with a pat. &ldquo;Well done Scout-Master, very well done.&rdquo;  Scout Vessla struggles, gagged and bound. He looks a mixed of frightened and frustrated.  He's in for some thorough questioning later.</p>
</div>

<div class="kidnapFail hidden">
<p>Scout-Master Krel was briefed on the mission. He apparently had no reservations about my orders for his troop to infiltrate and capture one of their own, but he seemed slightly concerned about not having full element of surprise, the village may be on some alert after we were turned away. So he insists on trying it at night.  It was a tense wait through the night. I decided to stay up and watch for their return. Scouts are renowned for their skill at silence and subtlety, few appreciate or perhaps realize the depth of their training. Its with this in mind my concern lies, as their target is equally trained and might prove a challenge that is aware of their methods. Just as dusk is brightening the horizon a cadre of shadows swoop in low over the canopy and toward the ship. The scouts return, empty handed and one scout short.  It is a slightly solemn looking Scout-Master that reports.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scout Vessla has escaped, our mission is a failure. He must have have anticipated our move, being a scout and helped the Islanders set an ambush for us. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Scout Vesslas desertion and betrayal is complete then. I growl at hearing this, pounding the railing with my fist angrily. But then I nod toward the Scout-Master Krel to continue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were all set upon and most of us captured as we moved in for the grab. Only Scout Flute escaped the snare but refused to retreat or surrender and kept fighting until she was overpowered. She wounded one of them, the painted young chief and was consumed by Scout Vessla. They were pretty angry about that, I thought they were going to force us all going to join her in his belly. Scout Vessla managed to talk them down, but he kept Scout Flute. Then they evacuated the village, packed everything hastily and left. They us go after they had mostly all left, I believe it will be hard to find them. &ldquo;</p>

<p>I nodded. They will have scattered and be well on their way to the nearby islands by now.  This was a blow against our progress. I took a deep breath and exhaled, I had to accept the situation and move forward. I nodded to Scout-Master Krel who was waiting for my reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get some rest for you and the Scouts. This is a set-back, but decision and fault was mine. I am sorry about Scout Flute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knew her duty.&rdquo; Scout-Master Krel only nodded and then moved below deck with his reduced scout cadre.</p>

<p>It was unlikely we would run into Scout Vessla again. But if we did, there would be a reckoning.</p>
</div>

<div class="arrest hidden">
<div class="garschText hidden">
<p>I decide to send in a force to arrest him. His actions have been very unbecoming and require a stern response. </p>

<p>The troop is small, any more of them and they'd be tripping over each other on the trail, but they're armed and armored more then the Islanders could ever be and led by a capable officer. <br />
My paws itch with the desire to be out there with them, to face and see them through any danger my orders might put them in myself. But reluctantly, I understand the restrictive policy. Having the captain throw themselves into every situation would quickly lead to a shortage of captains. </p>

<p>The first sign of trouble is a plume of smoke rising from the central island thats larger then what cooking fire should be. No messenger arrives, asking for reinforcements however, which is either promising or very foreboding. </p>

<p>In the end, my troop emerges from the brush and return to the ship. Garsch, with a fresh cut, delivers the report. The other members of the troop look dirty and roughed up, some are sporting rather full bellies, especially a Raptorian. </p>

<p>&ldquo;We met opposition Captain. They hounded us from the trees on the trail, they had expected us. They drew first blood and we took a casualty.&rdquo;<br />
I saw them carrying the injured Awe below deck. It looks rough, if Pouch-Matron Elda deems them too injured, they will be taken on by their closest comrade. <br />
&ldquo;I had us advance, double-pace, to the village in attack. Their resistance there was light, I believe merely delaying actions to allow their leadership and majority to escape. We found their hidden main-entrance, but they had already made off with their canoes Captain. The target, Scout Vessla, must be with them.&rdquo;<br />
I found my fur bristling in irritation. The assault had failed, but not from any fault of my Awes. Scout Vessla had deserted and tribe Lanaga chosen to oppose themselves to our cause. <br />
While we possibly could set a pursuit and catch up to their canoes, it was not our main goal and might set us on a long chase where our quarry has intimate familiarity with local territory and its chains of islands. <br />
I dismiss Officer Garsch so he can get his cut treated while I mull over our next destination. <br />
</p>
</div>
<div class="nyxieText hidden">
<p>I decide to send in a force to arrest him. His actions have been very unbecoming and require a stern response. <br />
Since we have knowledge of their main entrance and good landing, I feel confident the armed troop I send should be able to do the job. We'll have equal numbers but better arms, armor and training. <br />
My paws itch with the desire to be out there with them, to face and see them through any danger my orders might put them in myself. But reluctantly, I understand the restrictive policy. Having the captain throw themselves into every situation would quickly lead to a shortage of captains. <br />
The fighting turned out to be fierce. A messenger Awe comes flying, reporting high resistance, situation stable but asking for support and I have a second boatload of armed Awes sent out there to reinforce them. </p>

<p>Soon a dark plume of smoke rises from the center of the island, it doesn't seem to spread too far across the foliage, but it seems clear the village has been set ablaze. <br />
A victorious but tired troop soon return. It takes several trips with boats to retrieve them all due to the added weight of their bellies and occasional prisoner. <br />
Officer Garsch, with a fresh cut and a sagging full belly-prize of his own, delivers his report. <br />
&ldquo;We captured the Scout and neutralized the tribe, Captain.&rdquo; He started, stifling a belch expertly.<br />
&ldquo;They were half-expecting us, but not the speed of our deployment. We were upon them as they were readying to leave and preparing their small craft. We secured their landing and all its canoes, stranding them on the island and they fought hard to dislodge us a while.&rdquo;<br />
Officer Garsch turned to glance at a couple of wounded being carried below deck. They looked bad, if Pouch-Matron Elda deems them too injured, they will be taken on by their closest kin or comrade on the ship. <br />
&ldquo;After we received reinforcement we managed to push them back. Their big elder leader fell, a Raptorian got him and the rest broke, many fled into the woods. We torched the village and the canoes, but there might have been other hidden ones deeper on the island.&rdquo;<br />
Garsch paused in his debriefing to heft his heavily engorged belly up. Despite his age he carried it well, but it was clearly taxing. A tied up Scout-Vessla was led below deck, throwing a forlorn look at the both of us. <br />
&ldquo;Scout Vessla, as far as I can tell, did not partake in the fighting and surrendered after I bested and consumed the younger Chief in single combat in the village. He refused to surrender.&rdquo; Officer Garsch finished explaining, looking eager for rest.<br />
I pat my officer on the shoulder firmly and congratulate him on a job well done. He'd receive a commendation for this. I dismissed him to get some rest and digest his meal.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="invitation hidden">
<p>I choose to agree to the invitation and make preparations to visit the island.  Though standard doctrines demand the captains remain aboard the ship as much as possible, I'm more then happy to get my own paws dirty. Undoubtedly one of the downsides of becoming the captain was the sudden lack of adventurous assignments. </p>

<p>The question remains what kind of escort to bring however. </p>

<p>I could bring an armed escort, a secure option that'll keep my officers happy and a show of power to the Islanders.</p>

<div class="garschText hidden">
"Since the landing site is difficult and the trail through the rough brush to the village that we forged narrow and rugged, we can only bring a smaller team." Garsch huffed when prompted about it.</p>
</div>

<p>There is also the option of a more diplomatic approach, by going mostly alone. I fear no Islanders and the Scout seemed to be in good health, that should be a positive indication.</p>
</div>


<div class="escort1 hidden">
<p>I decide to go alone and show the Islanders that we do not fear them and neither should they fear us.  My officers nearly throw a fit at my decision and Officer Garsches disapproval is so great I'm forced to relent and bring at least a small diplomatic delegation with me. </p>

<p>We arrive at the village and its a surprisingly pleasant place. The dense woods open up into an enclosed clearing of sorts. Some of the huts are built into the oldest trees of the island while others are built by driftwood and branches, they all seem well built and cared for and its clear the place is well sheltered from outside weather. </p>

<p>Numerous Islanders, all colorful in their garb, markings and feathers; gather closely around me and gawk curiously, no doubt they've never seen an Awe Captain before.  There are few if any young Gryphs here, I reckon this might be a form of minor foraging village for a larger tribe elsewhere.</p>
</div>

<div class="escort2 hidden">
<div class="nyxieText hidden">
<p>I decide bring an armed detail with me. Two armed and armored Raptorians and a trio of experienced Awes under Garsches capable command should do. Any more and our landing boat would capsize. The hidden landing area is modest, but provides a sheltered area to tie up our boat and walk a cleared hidden path inland.</p>

<div class="garschText hidden">
<p>I decide bring an armed detail with me. One armed and armored Raptorians and two experienced Awes under Garsches capable command is all we can bring.

</div>


<div class="talksVillage hidden"><p><strong>Scout Vessla</strong></p>
<p>“Welcome to Lanaga, Captain.” A bushy looking Scout with prominent wings on display appeared. “I am Vessla.” The scout was garbed in the same tribal wear as the other villagers and had on him some painted markings.  On either side of him stood two Islander Gryphs of evident status, of who he introduced next. </p>

<p>“This is Forager Holixer.” He pointed a wing toward a burly looking seasoned Gryph. “And this is Chief-Son Darter” he pointed out next, a elaborately painted and decorated Gryph. The significance of their order of introduction seemed to indicate Holixer was in charge, despite Darters title. </p>

<p>I extended a wing to touch to touch the foragers in greeting before greeting the Chief-son. </p>

<p>“I am Captain Avolc of the Attentive.” I introduce myself with a nod and polite slight raise of my cap. </p>

<p>“Captain...” Forager Holixer squawked in low basso, looking like he was about to say more before Chief-Son Darter interjects by taking a step close. </p>

<p>“Would you join us for a feast Captain? Our hunters have been fortuitous and our nets have brought us a bounty of Saw-fins. It would give us time to speak and bond!” </p>

<p>The Chief-son was being quite eloquent and hospitable. However, despite his title and elaborate markings and dress, I sensed he might have spoken out of turn somehow. Forager Holixer looked less then pleased.</p>
</div>

<div class="talksVillage2 hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>“Very well, let us dine and acquaint.” I replied, eying Scout Vessla firmly. “But this is not just a social visit.”</p>

<p>“Of course captain, all in due time.”</p>

<p>Its not long before my party and I are relocated to some low tables by a cooking fires where the scent of tantalizing food was emanating from the pots and wrapped leaves.  I was surprised the Islanders did not just gulp the fish raw, but prepared them so elaborately.</p>

<p>As we ate, Scout Vessla sat quietly on the other side of Chief-Son Darter, hiding. The Chief-son soon proved to be quite fluent in Trade-speech and a talkative character. </p>

<p>“Captain, Vessla has told us much about your nation and people. To think such a large land lay to the east, not far beyond the sea. We knew from old tales there lay but treacherous rocks in cold waters. But a whole sprawling land with tall mountains and a people such as yours! What wonders!” </p>

<p>He continued enthusiastically. </p>

<p>“The Lanaga, have always held the isles of the south and the east of 'The Thousand', they are sparse and spread wide, but we grew up long thinking we were a people on the edge of the world. But then, more and more Kingdom ships start sailing past, back and forth. No longer are we a people left to our own at the edge of the sea, but a tribe caught in the middle of lands and nations of a vaster world.“</p>

<p>I quirk my head, trying to catch the meaning behind his little tale.  “An opportunity perhaps?” I query. </p>

<p>“For whom? Us? Already great thirsty fleets sail past our isles. Vessla has informed us the people of the Awes seek cooperation with Lanaga. Seek also an isle for themselves to settle and rest their ships at.” </p>

<p>“A naval port, this is correct” I reply.</p>

<p>“What benefit would this bring the tribe of Lanaga?”</p>
</div>


<div class="talksVillage2b hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<div class="protection hidden">
<p>Protection. Surely the recent piracy in these seas must have been a concern for the Lanaga?” I replied.</p>

<p>Forager Holixer harrumphed loudly, indicating that perhaps they had. Chief-Son Darter however made a non-committal shrug. </p>

<p>“They do not come to rob us like they do the traders, because we have little but canoes and nets. They do forage our lands without asking, yes. But so are you.” Darter pointed firmly at me. </p>
</div>
<div class="trade hidden">
<p>"Trade for one. There are many goods your tribe could acquire that im sure you are unable to produce out here in the isles." I replied. </p>

<p>“This is true” Darter agreed. “In the same vein there must be little of ours that is of interest to you... Except, territory perhaps! So in return for trinkets and shiny baubles we agree to sign away our isles, one after another. Am I right?”</p>
</div>
<p>I was about to reply and defend myself when Forager Holixer leaned forward and motioned placatingly. </p>

<p>“The question of allegiance and trade, is not ours to make. It is for Chief and Elders of Lanaga to decide. Saw-fin season is soon to end and we will then make our way home there and bring your proposals for consideration.”</p>

<p>“I have outlined the Admiraltys request and proposals and have them in written form.” Scout Vessla squeaked from his seat. “I could be of further help as a negotiator when they return to the main isles.”  </p>

<p>Scout Vessla has broached the subject of my visit and the company around the dining table grew quiet in apprehension to how I would respond. I would ofcourse not let him go as easily as that.</p>

<p> I can begin the negotiations or ask some questions, keep things civil for a while longer. Once we begin negotiating, there will be little oppertunity left for pleasantries. </p> 
</div>

<div class="qlanaga hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>“Im curious about your tribe, the Lanaga. What can you tell me about your people, have you always lived here?”</p>

<p>Forager Holixer straightens and seems to eye me with a glimmer of approval and pride. He seems happy I've asked and equally happy to answer. </p>

<p>“The Lanaga tribe, like all other adopted tribe, carry the ancient name of their lost home city or region from old Preenlon. We've existed on these isles for countless generations now since the fall. <br />
We were always small in number, thus we had to be satisfied with the isles furthest out to sea.</p>

<p>These are meager conditions, Captain. What grows here grows slowly, especially this far out. One can not harvest the isles recklessly or risk upsetting the frail balance.<br />
Our ancestors learned this the hard way, it was only due to the generosity of the resident tribes that they endured long enough to learn. Learn that we do not adopt the isles, the isles adopt us. </p>

<p>It made us strong and wise however, we are able to live comfortably now and not contend too much over territory with other tribes. <br />
</p>
</div>

<div class="qnowhere hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>“In our travels, one certain location has come to our interest. One we have unfortunatly scant information about. Have you heard about Port Nowhere and its current location?”</p>

<p>Forager Holixer that leaned forward in response to this querry. The sizable gryph made a uncertain flexing of wings and furrowed his brow in a scowl. </p>

<p>“The roaming Port Nowhere, yes. We have heard of it. In the past we have also had dealings with it when it has strayed close to our domains. But I was but a young wee down when that was last.”</p>

<p>“So its true then, its a floating port of some kind?” I ask curiously. </p>

<p>“Aye, a city of the sea that goes where the tides favor it. It has long history and has many legends. Im afraid im not familiar with all of them, the Thousand isles have too many legends and marvels for me to bother keep track of.” </p>

<p>“Lanaga lays far from the current roaming parts of Port Nowhere, there lays many tribes between us that may have more answers. Though not all of them may be as hospitable as the Lanaga.”</p>
</div>

<div class="qtribes hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>“You said there were many tribes out there. Are there any nearby you can tell me anything about, perhaps their whereabouts? If there are any we should be cautious about?” I ask. </p>

<p>“Understand that the Tribes of the isles are both family and rivals in one. It would be poor conduct, nay, dishonorable according to Island law; For me to speak ill of our brethren, even if we are not at best of terms. <br />
Hospitality and attitude will differ, I believe none of the Tribes are known to host ill will to travelers and visitors however, so I will not caution you from any of our brethren Tribes.” Holixer explained patiently. <br />
I could by nod in acknowledgement. It was a scant and evasive answer at best. <br />
I had planned to be cautious of all tribes we were to meet so this information did not really change any of that. </p>

<p>“I can tell you that to our direct west, the larger Tribes you are likely to meet are the Kaelani and to the north of them, the Cold Claws. The Kaelani are like us, adopted Tribe, while the Cold Claws are resident Tribe.”</p>
</div>

<div class="qtribes2 hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>“Adopted? Resident?” I ask curiously. </p>

<p>“Ah, what is common lore for us must be very unfamiliar to outsiders. There exists many types of Tribes in the Isles. Adopted tribes, are the people who hold some heritage to old Preenlon. Have you heard of it?”</p>

<p>I nod my head vaguely. Some old history was not all familiar, but I do know alot of the military structure of the Admiralty was adopted by ancient Preenlon teachings. Forager Holixer is all happy to fill me in however. </p>

<p>“This was long ago, ages go. The Republic of Preenlon used to be the greatest nation in the world. But it fell to treachery and a Gator Warlord who razed it all and who's armies devoured all who remained. Our ancestors are those who fled, who chose the meagre isles as their home rather then live as serfs in the Kingdom, became the adopted. For it was the Isles that adopted us, not us that adopted the Isles.” </p>

<p>“The Residents are those whom have always been here then?” I ask. </p>

<p>“Indeed! It was them that taught our ancestors how to live and thrive here. They are the original authors of Island Law. They are few, but the most hospitable of Island tribes.<br />
I warn you however that should you meet any, you might find their customs peculiar or strange.” Holixer smiled. </p>

<p>“In what way?” I asked. Holixers smile turned to a laugh before he replied. <br />
 <br />
“They always mean well, but they have their own way of showing it or interpreting whats best for you. That might mean showering you in gifts, make a stew out of you, trying to marry you off sons and daughters or smoke mushrooms with you, all in one day.”</p>

<p>“In that order?” That sounded like a strange idea of hospitality. “A stew?”</p>

<p>“Some variation of it. Dont be alarmed, its more a pampered warm herb bath.” </p>

<p>I nodded uncertainly. </p>

<p>“There exists some nomad tribes too, not quite residents, its said they are even older to the isles, they claim they lived here when this was all land, not sea. A very small people, in population and stature. Smaller then you, Captain. You are unlikely to see them, but they exist. I have only seen them a few times myself.”</p>

<p>"All the tribes are different and have their own customs you'll find. We of the Lanaga highly value our responsibility to our tribe and our sworn words. Other tribes might have other core principles they hold higher in regard. </p>
</div>


<div class="scoutV hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>The group remained silent a while, before one of the Gryphs spoke up. </p>

<p>“The reason you have come to our village. Is to ask Scout Vessla to return to duty, correct?” Forager Holixer rumbled. </p>

<p>“Captain, I request permission to stay here with the Lanaga. I have been accepted into their tribe and can do a lot of good in terms of Awelands relations with the natives.”</p>

<p>With a sigh I frowned, staring hard at the scout. He was indeed quite eager to stay and did not seem pressed. It could well be that he could stay and 'possibly' do the good he claims, but a scout was a very valuable asset to loose.</p>
</div>


<div class="talks hidden"><p><strong>Scout Vessla</strong></p>
<p>Scout Vessla is a bushy brown furred and older scout then I'm used to seeing. He's carrying garments like those the islanders have, it seems he had been integrating quite well with them. </p>

<p>There's a slight unmistakable air of distance in him toward us, he stands firmly with the islanders and does not quite seem to be hopping with joy to me back among his own kind. </p>

<p>“Scout Vessla reporting as requested.” He muttered brusquely and stood at attention as I approached.</p>

<p>“Im Captain Avolc of the Attentive.” I turn my gaze toward the islanders and Scout Vessla motions as he introduces them.</p>

<p>“This is Forager Holixer and Chief-Son Darter.” The scout switches to Trade-tongue, the language of the kingdom and the common language used in the west. I note how he introduced the larger 'Forager' before what I assume is the smaller but more elaborately painted supposed son of the chieftain, Darter.</p>

<p>I extend a wing to touch the Foragers before the Chief-sons.</p>

<p>“Fortuitous greetings.” I greet them neutrally but pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Honored Leader.” Forager Holixer curtsies with a bow of his head while Chief-Son Darter, who remains silent stands tall. He looks around slightly dissapointed at the festive lighting.</p>

<p>“What brings you to Lanaga territory, Captain?” Scout Vessla asks absently. I frown at him, normal procedure would be to report for duty, he's clearly keeping a distance.</p>

<p>“I was told I could find you here, you were left on assignment by the Fleet. A Fleet I'm trying to come in contact with. I'd like your report and aid in locating their whereabouts, Scout.”</p>

<p>Scout Harbinger stands not far out of view and Vessla meets his eyes briefly before nodding.</p>

<p>“The Fleet-Admiral left me here to negotiate the Lanaga tribes future cooperation with Admiralty operations in the area. They lay claim to this area of sea and its resources as their foraging grounds.” The scout explains.</p>

<p>I quirk my brow at this. It was not what I heard from Scout Harbinger.</p>

<p>“Oh? You received such additional instructions were you to make contact with the natives?” I switch to Awe tongue. “I don't believe Admiralty officially recognizes any claim to these islands.”</p>

<p>This seems to test Scout Vessla who knits his brow eyes me sternly.</p>

<p>“Captain! My orders were to make contact, yes. But during my time here I've learned much of their customs and society. They may not be a recognized nation, but they have ancestral claim to this region of sea and we'd do well to respect them if we want future naval operations to remain peaceful.”</p>

<p>His defensiveness and tone is a little sudden, the Gryphs shift uncomfortably at the clipped anger in his tone, though they don't seem to understand the Aweish words. It seems he had gotten quite attached to his hosts and perhaps them to him.</p>

<p>“Lower your hackles Scout.” I warn him. “I'm not here to make policy or drive anyone off their islands. You better explain where this attitude is coming from, I have no patience for subtleties.”</p>

<p>The scout seems to visible force himself to calm and meets my eyes.</p>

<p>“Alright Captain. I will explain.</p>

</div>

<div class="talksb hidden"><p><strong>Scout Vessla</strong></p>

<p>“Fortuitous greetings.” I greet them neutrally but pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Honored Leader.” Forager Holixer curtsies with a bow of his head while Chief-Son Darter remains standing smiling and eyeing the welcoming feast.</p>

<p>“Your invitation is quite unusual. Normally it is the task of the resident to host the guests, but we of the Lanaga are never ones to turn down an offered feast. It looks like you have arrayed quite a hospitable one, Captain Avolc!” Darter motioned to the table of food. </p>

<p>“Officer Keeper here is responsible for the feast.” I motioned to the Green wulf, who bowed courteously by my side to the Islanders. </p>

<p>“Pleased to be met, honored guests. Please be seated and enjoy yourselves.” Keeper cooed. </p>

<p>The thinner of build Chief-Son Darter rubs his hands together eagerly at the feast, seeming quite delighted at our show of hospitality. He seems more fascinated about nibbling at the wide selection of what must be quite exotic food for an islander. </p>

<p>Unlike the thickset Forager Holixer who is quick to seat himself and help himself to whats on offer along with what I assume is a couple of senior unintroduced bodyguards or foragers. </p>

<p>Scout Vessla has seated himself among the islander, away from our crew. He is glancing around nervously, avoiding eye contact. There is something peculiar about his demeanour.</p>

<p>The guests seem relaxed and put at ease. This is a chance to talk or I can cut straight to the chase and talk to the Scout about a debriefing and his return to duty.</p>

</div>

<div class="talks2 hidden"><p><strong>Scout Vessla</strong></p>
<p>Once we've seated in the meeting room, I steeple my paws together and observe the way the Chief-son seats himself close to the Scout. They have an unmistakable tender sort of familiarity with each-other. I stow that observation away for later. </p>

<p>“So. Scout Vessla, why don't you begin from the beginning.” I Offer in Trade-speech for the benefit of our guests.</p>

<p>“We spotted the Lanagans during our movement through the area. The Fleet-Admiral had hoped to gain some local information about the force opposing us most of all. But they proved elusive to our efforts for contact and I volunteered to stay and gather information.”</p>

<p>“Well, it seems you were successful in your efforts, the Fleet-Admiral will be pleased once we find them.” I nod toward the Gryphs. To my surprise Forager Holixer speaks up with a firm tone and hard stare.</p>

<p>“Vessla has joined tribe Lanaga. Only his 'report' need return, not his person.”</p>

<p>I pause at this, incredulous and turn to Vessla for some sort of explanation, but he remains silent, avoiding eye contact.</p>

<p>“Am I to understand Vessla is your prisoner?” Yet as I ask this, it makes little sense for them to be here on my ship, just the three of them if this was the case.</p>

<p>“No! Vessla is no prisoner. He is now Lanaga.” He continues with his burly croaking voice, the Chief-son meanwhile straightens, raising his crest with confidence and challenge while the Forager speaks for him. “We are here to ensure his wishes are heard and he not be taken away against his will.”</p>

<p>I find myself briefly at a loss for words and eye them back and forth, but they seemed entirely straight-faced serious. Even as I struggle at what end to grip this unexpected twist of an issue, Vessla noticeably inches closer to Darter.</p>

<p>“I'm not sure I understand. You joined the Islanders?” I find myself asking in Aweish.</p>

<p>“I did! They were very hospitable once they got over their initial suspicion of me. I came to appreciate their ways and way of life.” He eyed the blue feathered Gryph who smiled back at him. “I wish to stay.”</p>

<p>I suspected there was more going on then was being said. In truth it was not my business.</p>

<p>But what gives me strongest pause is the scouts abandonment of his sworn enlisted duties. One can not just decide to quit and go native somewhere. We Awes enter a contract when we volunteer to serve, we are trained, housed and fed and in return we protect our society, our home.</p>

<p>They fear I have come to reject his decision and drag him back to his duties. And as his superior, I have every right to do this, by Admiralty law.  </p>

</div>

<div class="talks2b hidden"><p><strong>Scout Vessla</strong></p>
<p>After a little more time of light polite conversation, I decide its time to talk business. </p>

<p>“Perhaps its time to speak about the mission at hand and why we're all here.” I said, leaning forward to steeple my paws together. <br />
“The Attentive is here to locate the Admiralty fleet and Scout Vessla is expected to return to duty with us to aid us in this endeavour.” </p>

<p>“Captain, the Fleet-Admiral left me here to make contact but also negotiate the Lanaga tribes future cooperation with Admiralty operations in the area. They lay claim to this area of sea and its resources as their foraging grounds.” The scout explains.</p>

<p>“Oh? You received such additional instructions were you to make contact with the natives?” I raise my brow. This is not quite what Scout Harbringa reported. </p>

<p>“My orders were to make contact, yes. But during my time here I've learned much of their customs and society. I wish to stay, no I wish to demand to stay.” </p>

<p>“Vessla has joined tribe Lanaga.” Holixer spoke up with a gravely firm voice. “He has expressed a desire for our protection and we have granted it.”</p>

<p>I find myself briefly at a loss for words and eye them back and forth, but they seemed entirely straight-faced serious. Even as I struggle at what end to grip this unexpected twist of an issue, Vessla noticeably inches closer to Darter who smiles mischievously.</p>

<p>“I'm not sure I understand. You joined the Islanders?” I find myself asking in Aweish.</p>

<p>“I did! They were very hospitable once they got over their initial suspicion of me. I came to appreciate their ways and way of life.” He eyed the blue feathered Gryph who smiled back at him. “I wish to stay.”</p>

<p>I drum the table in puzzled thought, this was most unusual. No matter what he is telling himself, Scout Vessla is abandoning his duty. One could even argue its desertion under the strictest sense of Admiralty law.<br />
</p>

</div>
<div class="letgo hidden"><p><strong>Let him go</strong></p>
<p>There's no point forcing someone into service. If their loyalty is elsewhere, they cant fully be trusted to perform their duties. </p>

<p>I find myself letting out a deep sigh. The trio have patiently waited for me to finish considering their words.</p>

<p>“I want a full report and as much intelligence you can muster, Scout Vessla. When we leave here without you there should be nothing useful in your mind thats not in a report. You hear me?” I speak slowly in Trade-Tongue.</p>

<p>Vessla seems to beam and relaxes visibly with relief. Darter emits a coo and chirp and Forager Holixer nods in a pleased manner of agreement.</p>

<p>“Honored Leader, your generosity will not be forgotten by Lanaga tribe! Awe will be true friend of the isles. May there be union of winged fur and feather, we shall accept all Awe who wish be Lanaga.” Darter spoke up for the first time, his voice almost musical.</p>

<p>Committed to the decision I feel its best to take advantage to the positives it might bring.</p>

<p>“Awes likewise accept any Islander who'd wish to align their cause with ours.” I venture carefully. Darter accepts it with a courteous nod.</p>

<p>Out meeting is finished and Vessla is put to work writing down his gained knowledge of the Isles and the Lanagas.</p>

<p>Chief-Son Darter meanwhile has invited me and the ships crew over for a night of festivity with their tribe on the island as guests. </p>

<p>But I have politely turned him down as kindly as I could. We are as pressed as ever for time and though I didn't say as much, I did not wish for any other of the crew to get seduced into any bright ideas. </p>
</div>

<div class="letgo2 hidden"><p><strong>Let him go<br /></strong></p>
<p>
I've heard enough. Scout Vessla is clearly unwilling for duty and thus unfit. <br />
It grates on me to give in and let him go. He's clearly breaking the rules, he cant decide for himself what his duties are, its nothing less but desertion. However to punish him accordingly is currently out of my paws and might be more pricey then letting him stay. Though it sets a bad precedent. <br />
“Fine. Stay. But you do so under my objection and it will be a mark on your record.” <br />
“If thats so, I don't need to care about that. I am Lanaga now. But I will not forget my duties, I will speak for Aweland and still try to speak our cause. I will even provide you with what information I have about the fleet. I ask you though, to leave us alone after that. ” <br />
I huff in slight contempt but cross my arms.</p>
</div>

<div class="negotiate hidden"><p><strong>Negotiate</strong></p>
<div class="nyxieText garschText hidden">
<p>“I suppose there is no further delaying it. We need to talk about Scout-Vessla.” I straighten firmly in my seat and eye each of them in turn. “You still have your duty to the Admiralty.”</p>
</div>
<div class="keeperText hidden">
<p>“This is not acceptable. You are abandoning your duties to the Admiralty and I cannot just let that slide.” I shook my head firmly. </p>
</div>
<p>“But Captain! This isn't just about me, its a great opportunity to further a relationship between the peoples of the Isles and Aweland. Whats... whats one Awe here and there, you can do without me!”</p>

<p>Whatever his relationship with the Islanders, I get a sense he more seems to fear returning rather then leaving. I have chance to reason this over peacefully.</p>

<div class="keeperText hidden">
<p>We are currently on the Attentive, so that gives me quite a bit of advantage incase I want to be more forceful. That action is unlikely to garner much trust with the tribe however.</p>
</div>
<div class="armed hidden">
<p>I have my armed escort with me, they  lend me quite a bit of impact to a hard-lined approach. </p>
</div>
<div class="unarmed hidden">
<p>I've come without an armed escort. Hopefully that sign of goodwill will lend itself well. </p>
</div>
<p>I can try to appeal to the Islanders, perhaps they can be appeased in some way to agree with me. Or I can put the squeeze on Scout Vessla. </p>

<p>Lastly, I can stop being polite and let them know whats what.</p>
</div>
<div class="negotiate2 hidden"><p><strong>Negotiate</strong></p>
<p> It seems I've reached a dead end with that line of approach. But they're still listening, so I might still have a shot at convincing them, one way or another.  </p>
</div>

<div class="question hidden"><p><strong>Question his Fear</strong></p>

<div class="ship hidden">
<p>“There's more to this then you are letting on Vessla. I'm not going to question your affection for these people, but it sounds to me like there is more keeping you away then to stay.” I switch to Aweish again. Much to the seeming annoyance of the two Gryph guests. But they say nothing except ruffle their plumage lightly. Vessla seems to hesitate, but my piercing gaze and words seems to hit home. </p>

<p>“I assume you were in the first skirmish with the hostile force. Did the thunder-weapons scare you that much?” </p>

<p>“I... No, you don't understand. Its... just. The Fleet-Admiral, she's... ” He seems to look for words. “Driven. Beyond driven. She's a force of nature Captain. The weapons scared me, of course, they did everyone. But not her!”</p>

<p>I cock my head at this, wondering what he's getting at.</p>

<p>“This doesn't sound like a thing to run away from. A strong leader to rally under is ideal under such circumstances, no?” </p>

<p>“Yes... but. You haven't met her Captain. I... felt like I was being swept away in a vengeful avalanche and had to pull myself to safety before it reached the precipice! She will stop at nothing, its victory or doom.”</p>

<p>I sigh and shake my head. I know the Fleet-Admiral has a reputation for being a tough fluff, even in her Matron age. Still, thats no valid reason for this “flight”. I let him know as much.</p>

<p>“Surely you understand that this is not good enough a reason for me to accept.” </p>

<p>“Accept it or not, this is the choice I have made and wish you'll respect Captain.” Vessla snaps in Trade-Tongue. The two Gryphs shift closer to him defensively. They had not understood most of the exchange but stand with their tribesman. Too much argument and they are likely to break off these talks and leave me with fewer harder choices. </p>
<p> Perhaps I can press him further, or try to reassure him of his fears with safety under my command. </p>

<p>“Accept it or not, this is the choice I have made and wish you'll respect Captain.” Vessla snaps, fur bristling. Chief-Son Darter scoots closer to give him a reassuring pat on the back. One thing is for certain, he is genuinely scared of the Fleet-Admiral.<br />
But thats not a good enough excuse. Perhaps I can press him further, or try to reassure him of his fears with safety under my command.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="reassure hidden"><p><strong>Reassure</strong></p>
<p>He's clearly gone so far as to risk desertion rather then return. <br />
“I think I understand.” I spoke calmly. “I've heard of Fleet-Admirals reputation. Perhaps her way of command is a little overwhelming?”</p>

<p>“Its not so much that she's intense Captain, I'd expect no less from an Admiral. I just don't want part of the kind of... war, that she is driven at pursuing. It has swept up nearly all the other captains too.” </p>

<p>I could not speak of changing the Fleet-Admiral on his behalf. However, I could reassure him of safety under my command. <br />
“So join my crew, I'm not part of the fleet. My mission is to find them, yes. But only to resupply them and assess their status and return once the tides permit passage.” </p>

<div class="unarmed hidden">
<p>The Scout eyed me closely, as if trying to gage my character there and then. I had listened to him peacefully and was now providing a way out that did not mean carrying the guilt of abandoning his own kind. <br />
“Perhaps... you're not as bad as the others.“ He turns to gaze at the other Two gryphs and down at his own matching clothing. “You've certainly been more reasonable then me.” He sighed.</p>
</div>

<div class="armed hidden">
<p>The Scout eyed me closely, as if trying to gage my character there and then. His eyes wandered to my armed escort who loomed not far from my flanks.</p>
<p>"I would like to believe you Captain. But I fear you might just be more of the same." </p>
<p>"Nothing is certain, I could be, but sometimes Awes must fight." I reply, staying as truthful as i can. </p>
</div>
<div class="ship hidden">
<p>The Scout eyed me closely, as if trying to gage my character there and then. Then his gaze wandered to the ship around him, eyes finding the armed Awes politely but subtly standing around on guard and he visibly recoiled. </p>
<p>"I would like to believe you Captain. But I fear you might just be more of the same. There just is not enough trust." </p>
<p>"Nothing is certain, I could be, but sometimes Awes must fight." I reply, staying as truthful as i can. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="shame hidden"><p><strong>Shame</strong></p>
<p>“Listen to yourself Scout. This is all highly irresponsible to your duty, to your people!” I scold in firmly. </p>

<p>“This is a time of crisis for our people. Our homeland was attacked and there are clear foes opposing us here in these seas. The Lanaga are clearly not one of them and that is good, but you'd rather hide among them then do what you are sworn and trained to do!” I give them all a tough glare and disgruntled frown.</p>

<p>Forager Holixer most of all seems to shift uncomfortably to the accusations, even if they're not directed at him. </p>

<p>“But Captain... I've served the Admiralty for many years! This is my third and final rotation, I'm not far from... retirement.” Even as he says it his voice wavers, realizing his own trap.</p>

<p>“Thats right. You are still in rotation, no matter how you feel about it.” I cross my arms firmly but lower my voice. “Or does the Lanaga tribe not welcome back those who return from defending their 'tribe' of birth?”</p>

<p>Forager Holixer straightens his crest and crawks. “Lanagara always welcomes back their own.” He turns aside to eye Darter and Vessla. “We protect our own, our family. Our home-isles.”</p>

<p>It sounds like there is some reluctant approval among the Lanagans.</p>
</div>

<div class="appeal hidden"><p><strong>Appeal</strong></p>
<p>The key to turning this around might lay in the natives. I calmly turn to Darter and Holixer and adress them directly. </p>

<p>“Is there some service we can provide the Lanaga in exchange for the return of our Scout?”</p>

<p>“Captain!“ Scout Vessla protested. But I had judged Darter correctly, there was a glimmer of interest in his eyes, not outrage. The “prince” was young, but he knew ambition.</p>

<p>“Service? What are you proposing captain? Some form of trade for us to abandon our adopted tribes-mate?” Darter huffed. </p>

<p>“You wish to protect those you and yours, but so do I. We should be more aligned in our interests. Surely there must be some way to trade favors so we both get what we want.”</p>

<p>Scout Vessla looked back and forth between me and the Chief-son as a silence stretched. Darter shifted in his seat and then slowly grinned at me in a mischievous way. </p>

<p>“We have offered Vessla sanctuary and protection. It would be dishonorable to recind that.”</p>

<div class="favor hidden">
<p>“But you have proven honorable and sensible to me so far. Enough so that I can be convinced Vessla needs not our protection from you.” The decorated Chief-son cooed. </p>

<p>“That is quite wise of you, Chief-son Darter.” I nodded in agreement. </p>

<p>“Perhaps there is something you can do for me, as a personal favor, to change my mind.” Darter crossed his arms, looking smug.</p>

<p>I look to the senior Gryph, the unspoken leader and possible mentor to the Chief-son Darter. 
Holixer returns my gaze steadily. Stoic and mostly silent, he's certainly playing it wise. </p>

<p>I suppose I could approach either Gryph. However im not sure who'd be easier to convince to my cause and what conditions they might have. </p>
</div>
<div class="nofavor hidden">
<p>“I am normally quite agreeable and might have considered trading such favors with you. Now after I've met you and come to understand more of what he fears, I however feel I must decline your offer.” Darter made a dismissive gesture. <br />
 <br />
“The Chief-son has spoken.” Forager Holixer announced, adding his general agreement, before adding. "An oppertunity to redeem your trust by a demonstration of humbleness could be considered however." </p>

<p>Besides Holixers ominous offer, it seemed this line of negotiation was blocked. The Islanders did not trust me or like me. </p>

<p> I might as well hear him out, though I suspect I might not like it. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="holixer hidden">
<p>I look to the senior Gryph, the unspoken leader and possible mentor to the Chief-son Darter. <br />
Holixer returns my gaze steadily. Stoic and mostly silent, he's certainly playing it wise. </p>

<p>
“Forager Holixer” I turned to the more burly Gryph. “I recognize your seniority here. You must see i'm trying to be reasonable and diplomatic about this. We have rules, Scout Vessla has to return.”</p>

<p>Chief-Son Darter looked peeved at being ignored. Holixer however seemed slightly amused, his wing posture straightening. His brow soon furrowed as he seemed to consider his next words carefully. <br />
 <br />
“I appreciate and respect your path of negotiation. However, our vow of protection has been extended to Scout Vessla. It is not something our tribe would withdraw without considerable dishonor to our name.” Holixer said before he paused briefly and tapped the table in visible consideration.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, if you prove Scouts Vesslas fears unfounded by humbling yourself, there would be no doubt in anyone's mind that you have our adopted tribes-mates best intentions in mind and there would be no need for the protection.”</p>

<p>I was not sure I liked the sound of that and scowled at Holixer questioningly. </p>

<p>“The quality of a caring leader is displayed in what they'd be willing to do for a subordinate. Show that you can sacrifice your pride and put yourself in the mercy of another. Submit to one of the tribe and that would go a long way in convincing me. Its a gesture of trust that should make us both earn the others.”</p>

<p>I sighed and leaned back, eyeing the three of them on the opposite side of the table, I see what the older “Forager” was doing. <br />
Not only would this act be a tremendous gesture of goodwill and trust, it would also symbolically humble not only me, but in a way the whole Admiralty to the Lanaga.<br />
Holixer crossed his arms and stretched himself tall and looked determined, he was the epitome of an islander, thickly built and muscular. <br />
Leaner and younger Darter, with his decorative garb and markings had lost some of his irritation now and looked piqued, rubbing the bottom of his beak thoughtfully and giving me a wink. <br />
Scout Vessla, our wayward scout and the cause of all this, he shifted his wings and seemed afraid to make eye-contact. He knew he had put me in this position and was possibly a little dismayed, but piqued enough not to object on my behalf. </p>

<p>All three were options to choose from if I wanted to make the decision. I reckon some of them are more trustworthy then the others.</p>
</div>
<div class="nopick hidden">
<p>&quot;Your proposal is... not exactly generous, Forager Holixer. Though it is an opportunity of sorts, I must decline. There is more to such a gesture then simply just showing trust. I cannot undermine my position of authority by squirming around in either of your bellies, you must understand.&quot; I tried to keep my tone neutral, but honestly I was feeling a tad insulted by such bold proposals. </p>

<p>Holixer made a slow nod.  &quot;Perhaps I do understand.&quot; He said. Scout Vessla looked a tiny bit relieved why Chief-Son Darter visibly pouted in disappointment.</p>
</div>
<div class="holixer2 hidden">
<p>Holixer seemed to be the one with the power to undo whatever protections were in place that kept Scout Vessla from returning, it seemed only fitting to nod in his direction in assent of his proposal. </p>

<p>“Very well...” I replied slowly with appropriate pause. “I accept your proposal, I'm willing to demonstrate to you personally what I'll do for my crew. As long as I am able to return to them safely.” I said. </p>

<div class="island hidden">
<p>Holixer smiled and nodded once in approval. “No harm will ever come to a guest of the Lanaga. We shall build this trust between us.” He reassured while he absent mindedly rested a paw on his belly. </p>
</div>
<div class="ship hidden">
<p>Holixer smiled and nodded once in approval. “As you have hosted us in peace and safety, so will my body host you. We shall build this trust between us.” He reassured while he absent mindedly rested a paw on his belly. </p>
</div>
<p>The feast continued a while longer in idle conversation, Holixer seemed to be saving himself for the dessert for which I had signed myself up for. </p>

</div>

<div class="darter hidden">
<p>I turn my head toward the younger Gryph and cock my head at him briefly. Darter grins widely in return. <br />
It seemed wise, if I was to go through with this, to be in the favor of the stoic mentor and young tribal prince both. </p>

<p>“Very well...” I replied slowly with appropriate pause. “I accept your proposal, Im willing to demonstrate what i'm willing to do for my crew.” </p>

<p>“Very good Captain Avolc! You do honor to your name by such a demonstration of trust and humbleness.” Darter clasped his paws together eagerly, being unable unwittingly to lick his beak in anticipation.</p>
<div class="island hidden">
<p>“No harm shall come to you Captain, you are a honored guest of the Lanaga.” Holixer assured, nodding with approval. </p>
</div>
<div class="ship hidden">
<p>“No harm shall come to you Captain, we are your humble guests here.” Holixer assured, nodding with approval. </p>
</div>
<p>The feast continued a while longer in idle conversation. Darter was eyeing me closely throughout, he was eager to have his way with me.</p>
</div>


<div class="vessla hidden">
<p>I paused in thought a while but then nodded once in agreement and having made up my mind. In the end, the one I needed to convince to return was Vessla himself. I turned to him and motioned toward him. </p>

<p>“I shall accept your proposal. I'm willing to demonstrate to you what I'll do for my crew.”</p>

<p>Both the Gryphs turned to Scout Vessla who sat there blinking and taken aback. He looked like he had not expected me to make this choice, much less involve him in any matter. </p>

<p>“Vessla is indeed one of the tribe. That is acceptable to me, perhaps even symbolic for what we wish to achieve here.” Holixer nodded approvingly. </p>

<p>“Ah.. Captain... “ Scout Vessla gulped, spreading his wings wide in nervousness. “If you're sure, I can do it. I'll eat you, I mean.” He stumbled with his words.</p>
<div class="island hidden">
<p>“As long as I'll be able to safely return to my crew with you with me.” I replied coolly.</p>
</div>
<div class="ship hidden">
<p>“As long as you dont decide to carry me off to the island with you.” I replied coolly.</p>
</div>
<div class="island hidden">
<p>“Ofcourse, no harm shall come to a honored guest of the Lanaga.” Holixer said with a sweeping gesture. </p>
</div>
<div class="ship hidden">
<p>“No harm shall come to you Captain, we are your humble guests here.” Holixer assured, nodding with approval. </p>
</div>
<p>The feast continued a while longer in idle conversation. Vessla merely nibbled on some fruit, avoiding eye contact but still looking my way plenty often. Perhaps this choice has started to dissuade much of what has spooked him.</p>
</div>

<div class="vore hidden">
<div class="holixerVore hidden">
<p>Forager Holixer is certainly taller then me and of more weight too.<div class="island hidden"> I come quite aware of this as we retire somewhere more private, a kind courtesy by the senior Gryph.</div> <div class="ship hidden"> I come quite aware of this as we move to my chambers for more privacy, a kind courtesy by the senior Gryph. </div></p>

<p>&ldquo;You Awes surprise me. You are willing to go to great lengths for your goals. I am not sure if its fearlessness or otherwise.&rdquo; Holixer spoke as he watched me take off my cloak and gear. Wouldn't need those inside his stomach. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Not something you'd do if our positions were reversed?&rdquo; I asked. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so certain... Perhaps I am too attached to my pride, intangible as it is. &ldquo;</p>

<p>I had to give a grunt at that. I did have pride, I valued my reputation. The cost of being a good leader meant one had to weigh how much those mattered in the greater good. Letting Holixer temporarily consume me to gain their trust in not only me but the Admiralty seemed a small price to pay. It didn't hurt the matter that he wasn't bad looking. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, for the moment, I surrender my pride to yours.&rdquo; I announced and stood ready. </p>

<p>Holixer smiled genially and reached down grab a hold of me by the sides. He's a tall Gryph and bulky to boot, he lifts me up with ease.  &ldquo;While I promised to try return everything I take with this act, some small parts of things like that, might be added to mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Holixer yawned wide, revealing the depth of his sizable beak and deposited me head first inside his mouth. My chin brushed briefly against the back of his tongue before with a 'ulp' my whole head squeezed on into his gullet. </p>

<p>Holixer spared no time, he assertively pinned my arms and wings with his wide strong grip and pushed me down his throat with steady bobbing swallows. </p>

<p>I had been swallowed before, most of all in training in the academy. Being swallowed whole by a Gryph was not much different. The hard beak occasionally pressing down on my belly and back between swallows was different from the light nip of teeth.The way a Gryph swallowed their meals was different too, slightly less use of tongue and more toss of head and pull of throat muscles. Otherwise the slick and pulsing hot insides were like any others.    I felt Holixer shift his grip to my legs around ankles and with a forcible grip and shove, shunted me the rest of the way down into his body.  His stomach was surprisingly spacious, his visible large paunch was not just for show and now it no doubt swelled further into plumper fullness as I was squeezed into it.  I managed to curl myself up without too much discomfort, managing to even wiggle around and adjust slightly. </p>

<p>I sizable rumble and shake did push the chamber slightly tighter as Holixer belched contently with a loud 'Ouurrpphh!', I soon felt his paw drum and pat against the outside of the stomach as he seated himself to rest. The slight rumble of a contented crooning 'humm' vibrating around me along with the occasional wet 'glrp'.</p>

<p>Holixer had eaten me and done so with efficiency and no fuss. Hopefully my impression of his character was not off and he'd soon release me as promised. Somehow I felt that I could relax and trust that he would.  It was dark and warm, the paunchy belly of the stocky Gryph I now occupied was soft and roomy.  I found myself closing my eyes and leaning back peacefully, waiting for my eater to be content with this bargain. However long that would be.</p>
</div>

<div class="vesslaVore hidden">
<p>I picked Vessla because he was the smallest unknown. A fellow Awe and a potential subordinate, he would be the easiest to handle with the least potential surprises. </p>

<p>Though a Captain feeding herself to a subordinate is always a issue for appearance of authority, I still weighed the potential risks as lower. </p>

<p>Vessla soon moves over to seat himself next to me, seeming lost to words in how to proceed. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I... eat you somewhere more quiet?&rdquo; He finally asked, his fur bristling in nervousness. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Vessla.&rdquo; I replied. It seemed the scout had a little performance anxiety. More privacy and less of a display suited me well however. </p>
<div class="ship hidden">
<p>I led him away from arrayed feast and over to my personal quarters. I order us not to be bothered and my cadets know better than to question it. </p>

<p>Vessla looks around the room a while, it seems he's been living it quite rough as he treats my rather modest chambers like its the height of luxury. </p>
</div>
<div class="island hidden">
<p>&ldquo;Okay..! We can go to the hut they gave me. Its small but... well...&rdquo; He rose and started walk of, looking back only to confirm I followed.  The group watched us depart but remained at their feast. </p>

<p>Vesslas hut was indeed &ldquo;cozy&rdquo;, it was little more then a rudimentary shelter with enough space for a bedding on a pile of sand and a little place to sit beside it upon some dried reeds. I could not quite see the appeal of living here so roughly with these Islanders. </p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I'll be honest... I've never swallowed a female before. Much less someone of your... stature.&rdquo; Vessla gulped nervously. &ldquo;Why did you pick me?&rdquo; </p>

<p>&ldquo;I always trust in a fellow Awe then anyone else. As should you.&rdquo; I replied calmly. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose... but they're not bad these Islanders. Kind and caring...&rdquo; Vessla faltered, perhaps sensing my impatience. &ldquo;...ah well, lets get this over with.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Vessla awkwardly opened his mouth and closed it around my snout, he still looked nervous, like he expected me to lash out at any time and punish him. With my snout lodged in his muzzle, he began to swallow, dragging my head toward his tight gullet.  Its a few hesitant 'ulps' and 'glllps', but he manages to ingest me down to my shoulders before he picks up pace, swallowing reflexes kicking in gear and overriding his caution. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmmhhfff&rdquo; He seems to moan as stretches his jaws around my chest and pushes and swallows his way down over me. Any Awe can swallow another and there are only very few rare exceptions which have difficulties or conditions preventing them from doing so. Vessla is capable, but I can tell he's having some kind of problem with the way he shudders and moans in discomfort between reflexive rippling swallows.</p>

<p>My head pushes into his stomach eventually, its taken a while for him to work me down. But as the majority of my weight starts to rests in his gullet, the rest flows down with greater speed. I almost sense Vesslas relief as the rest of my body flows into his swollen belly, my body curling up in the dome of brown fur.</p>

<p>Its with a few urgent 'glucks' and gulps he swallows my feet and tail and I end up fully inside the scout. I can hear him panting, seeming out of breath and letting out a few groans. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah.. I... did it... &ldquo; He sighed in exhausted relief. I felt him shift and collapse backward to lay down, lungs still bellowing. &ldquo;Oh goodness....&rdquo; </p>

<p>The inside of his stomach was moderately cramped, I had been in Awe stomachs before, a male Awes stomach was always tighter due to their thinner frames and hips. It seemed Vesslas difficulties were less about accommodating me down here and more about the journey between. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry Captain... I just... have problems with tightness of chest.&rdquo; Vessla explained tiredly, his breathing still hard but calming down. &ldquo;I just need to rest a bit.&rdquo; </p>

<p>He sounded worn out. I couldn't imagine the process of getting me back up would be much easier.</p>
</div>

<div class="darterVore hidden">
<p>Darter has been giving me the eyes all through the rest of the conversation and meeting.  With his blueish feathered plumage and many swirling painted markings, he stands out quite visibly from both Awe and fellow tribes-mates alike, who all carry a shared variety of earthen colored complexion. </p>

<p>Its clear he is very eager about the prospect of eating me. I sense a fidgety impatience in him that is pushing against his obligation to remain polite and cordial.  He's a young and impatient Chief-son, not exactly spoiled but often pampered for the position his bloodline has granted him.  Now his eyes are on me, his curiosity is piqued and desires to know what its like to eat a Awe captain. Yet I chose this deal and him out of my options. </p>

<p>Eventually he can hold back no longer and rises from his seat.  &ldquo;Alright captain, shall we perhaps proceed with our agreement?&rdquo; Both his paws are on his painted belly as he speaks. &ldquo;I confess I am delighted and honored by your choice. There is no need to delay the joining of our bodies!&rdquo; </p>

<p>Holixer clears his throat in rebuke and Darter is quick to add. &ldquo;As a sign of unity and trust, this one evening I mean...&rdquo; </p>

<p>I step up to him to face him. Gryphs are taller then Awes and he despite his youth is about a half a head more so then me. But I still reckon we are not far off each other in weight. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall begin now...&rdquo; He grinned at me, seeming to size me up, then he motioned toward feast table by his seat. &ldquo;If you could please lie down on the table. I.. am sure I can manage you, but I hope you will cooperate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I huffed as he guided me down to lay down on the table, with my feet facing him. It seemed he intended to consume me like a part of the feast, right off the table. The main course for the royalty. </p>

<p>A warm moist beaked mouth closed around both my feet-paws as Darter sat down behind me and began to swallow me. The hot rhythmic tightness of his throat soon swept up along my legs to my thighs as worked his way up, pulling on belt to help himself work me down. </p>

<p>It occurred to me he did not seem terribly strained at all from fitting me down his gulping greedy beak. </p>

<p>Upon reaching my wait and belt, he fidgeted with my clasp briefly before with a grunt motioning for help.  A pair of paws moved in to help unbuckle my belt and remove my cloak quickly, I did not see whom, for Darters paws held me pinned down firmly against the table as he shifted to stuff the rest of my upper body into his bulging cheeks.  With my arms soon pinned and swallowed up to my mane, he hoisted me upward, almost with what seemed like a triumphant flourish. His body was tight around mine, squeezing hard to press me down into his visibly bulging belly. Looking down I could see the shape my lower body was making under those painted stretched markings. </p>

<p>His paw pushed at my nose as the gaping beak yawned its way around my head. For a moment he paused like this, with my ears and fur pressed forward along with my snout peering out of his yellow beak. He turned his body awkwardly to Vessla and judging by the Scouts brief flicker of amusement, he must have winked. </p>

<p>There was little time to be disgruntled or amused myself at him making a show out of eating me. With a wet swallow and a face-full of tongue, his beak closed around my head and he gulped, shutting out the outside world and welcoming me fully into his cramped body.  It did seem he was at the edge of his limits, for my head seemed to lodge in his neck and the repeated rippling wet gulps received a slight urgency to them. Had I wanted to, I could have escaped this situation, I wanted him to know this. Then I relaxed my lower body and let the muscles around me guide me down into Darters stomach. </p>

<p>The stomach of the Chief-Son was a cramped and tight space. The stomach-walls were taut unwilling to give much room to movement. I could hear the Gryph groan and shudder as he stifled a belch and sat back with his very prominently bloated belly.  He had managed me, enough to make a display as well, but his stomach was not used to portions my size. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Avolc is now within me, full and content has she made my belly.&rdquo; Darter announced contently. &ldquo;Lets continue the festivities, I need to rest a little.&rdquo; He chuckled, jostling my chambers slightly. </p>

<p>The chamber churned idly and I felt Darters paws knead vigorously over my curled up shape. His voice was muffled, but I could make out his words as she spoke to others around the table.  The way his stomach seemed to respond to his paws, it was clear enough he was easing a slight stomach-ache that I was giving him. There was only a few reasons to do that, his proposal was not long in following. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Ough... Captain. I must say I've enjoyed this more then I could have guessed. I feel you settling in to my belly now, like no meal has, like you always belonged.&rdquo; His paws pushed and kneaded, they were deceptively soothing. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Join with my body, be the first to do so and you'll take a honored place upon my person.&rdquo; He seemed to trace a digit along the markings of his belly. Poking at a spot, perhaps where they'd inscribe a permanent symbol for me. &ldquo;Do this and I will strive to ensure Awes are forever welcomed not only with Lanaga, but all we have influence with. A unity of our peoples for all who wish to follow our example.&ldquo;</p>

<p>They were loft words and high promises. Join a prince to secure a kingdom.  What a bold suggestion.</p>
</div>

<div class="digest hidden">
<div class="vesslaVore hidden">
<p>I let Vessla rest and catch his breath, affording him some courtesy until he felt ready to let me go. </p>

<p>A while passed and Vessla got quiet, his breathing was now shallow and more relaxed. It seemed he was at ease once more.  His stomach around me let out a ominous low 'grouurgh'. The muscles around me shifted and compressed with a steady churn. Being quite familiar with the sounds of an Awe stomach, I knew that was the sound mine made when gearing up to work off a a meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vessla?&rdquo; I queried, giving a jolt and a kick to the chamber to rouse him. </p>

<p>The stomach 'gllrrnn'ed in an annoyed tone at my kick and tightened itself around me defensively. Struggling just became harder.  I dawns on me that Vessla has fallen into deep slumber. His efforts to swallow me wore him out and in his attempt to calm his breathing has totally knocked him out.  His filled stomach has of course responded accordingly to his lack of consciousness and is now starting to take care of me the only way it knows how. </p>

<p>&ldquo;VESSLA!&rdquo; I shout angrily and jostle and kick outward. I put my training into it, but realize im in a slightly awkward positioning. Escape methods only work best after you've been immediately swallowed and you've not let your eaters stomach settle its grip around you.  Im upside down and sideways, my kicks wont jolt against sensitive organs and I cant shift position. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Vessla! What kind of amateur are you!&rdquo; I growl at him, grunting at the churning stomach-walls and heavy digestive liquids being squelched into my fur. Every Awe knows to stay awake when you have someone guesting in your belly. Giving in to the lethargy, to fully relax to sleep, is to agree to your body to take care of your meal!</p>

<p>Vesslas stomach was working on me now, it would be doing so capably and my time was limited as it would start to do so fast. I could but moan in muffled frustration and discomfort as I was completely in the mercy of my Scouts belly now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vessla...! Scout! You're....ghhh...&rdquo;  Through the noisy loud glrrrn and gurgle of digestion, my voice was hardly audible enough to make a difference. Vessla was digesting me and I was starting to feel that instinctive foretold lethargy myself. Its not much different from the one Vessla gave in to, just much less negotiable. I feel like I'm sinking... sinking deep. Deep into Vessla.... </p>
<div class="island hidden">
<p>- &ldquo;Hello? Are you in there Vessla?&rdquo; A familiar voice with a hint of concern calls from outside the hut.  Its Darter.  Vesslas head feels lost, dazed and like he forgotten something, but at the same time he's feels physically very comfortable.  &ldquo;Uh....&rdquo; He replies, gathering his thoughts. What day was it? &ldquo;Is everything alright, you two are taking some time.&rdquo; His voice shifted into bemusement with a hint of jealousy. &ldquo;I figured you needed some, you're a cute couple! I can stall them a while longer.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Vessla felt a rush of adrenaline as he pushed against his belly and felt only a squishy softness under his paws. A low gwuurrggll escaped him and he his eyed widened and his ears burned in a deeply embarrassed flush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I...I uh... we need... some more time.&rdquo; He replied urgently, fighting embarrassment and a little bit of panic. He is digesting her.... has digested her! Nothing solid left. He has digested a female, a captain! He has never digested anyone before, never thought he would, much less someone like that!</p>

</div>
<div class="ship hidden">
<p>&ldquo;Hello? Are you in there Vessla?&rdquo; A familiar voice with a hint of concern calls from outside the chamber door.  Its Darter.  Vesslas feels lost, dazed and like he forgotten something, but at the same time he's feels physically very comfortable.  &ldquo;Uh....&rdquo; He replies, gathering his thoughts. What day was it? Where was he? &ldquo;Is everything alright, we thought about returning soon, you two are taking some time. &rdquo; His voice shifted into bemusement with a hint of jealousy. &ldquo;I figured you needed some, you're a cute couple!

<p> Vessla felt a rush of adrenaline as he pushed against his belly and felt only a squishy softness under his paws. A low gwuurrggll escaped him and he his eyed widened and his ears burned in a deeply embarrassed flush.</p>

He has digested a female, a captain! He has never digested anyone before, never thought he would, much less someone like that!</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oookay...&rdquo; Darter hummed, he sounded a little tipsy and his footsteps soon departed. </p>

<p>Vessla sat up and grunted. His head was clearing. He could not stop staring at his rounded soft belly.  He slapped himself on the forehead, he had let himself sleep, he shouldn't have done that! He forgot that lesson.  But its not easy to remember something you were taught decades ago! He hasn't eaten anyone in just as long...  He lay back down to think and knead at his noisy gut. What else could he do?</p>

<p>A hour or two more, it would be morning. She'd be entirely gone then. Nothing but healthy paunch and added muscle and fat to his frame. Vessla had never felt so good in his life, never felt so strong!  With a sigh he stepped out of<div class="ship hidden">the former captains quarters</div><div class="island hidden"> the hut</div> and gave himself a stretch. He felt confident he could work things out, come what may.</p>

</div>
<div class="darterVore hidden">
<p>His flirtations and words, although slightly bombastic, had a pull I could not deny.  He'd eaten my so publicly, as if he'd knew he'd have me, now he wanted to just as publicly have me submit to him and become part of him in front of all to see. </p>

<p>I could almost sense the eyes of everyone around waiting for my reply and reaction. Everyone staring at Darters rounded full stomach with suspense.  I could not have made the agreement to everyone face, hidden inside Darter it was easier to just say it. To submit control to him. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain?&rdquo; The silence had made him hopeful, eager. &ldquo;Shall I add you to my tribe and person?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it... &ldquo; I found myself saying, loud enough to be heard outside. Loud enough so that I didn't have to repeat myself. </p>

<p>The chamber started to bounce and jostle as Darter let out a hearty laugh of delight.  &ldquo;She agrees! Hahah! She has agreed to my body!&rdquo; </p>

<p>There is a murmur of noise and talk, but somehow, it all seems detached now. With those words, the hot squishy kneading darkness around me, the body of this Gryph, was all that concerned me. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring out the casks and the paint. Let us do the marking now while my belly is so wide and big!&rdquo; Darter proclaimed jovially. </p>

<p>As time passed inside the stomach, I was soon joined by many gallons of liquid with sweetness and tang of alcohol. Darter was the center of attention and festivity and I sloshed around in the center of him.  He bid me stay still as the painted their upon his feathers, marking the occasion and union of my person to his. But he found time to speak to me, boastfully and comfortingly. </p>
<div class="magic hidden">
<p>(&ldquo;These markings is a symbol that mark you as bound to me now. A binding of royalty like mine are a little more sacred if the crones are to be believed.&rdquo; Darter chuckled. &ldquo;A way to unite true bloodlines and their peoples!&rdquo;) &ldquo;As the first Awe now part of me, we forge a bold new path together. Not only will you help me make me as big and strong as Holixer, you're a hopeful precedent further unity of our people.&rdquo; </p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps it was the drink and ego swelling his head, but Darter squawked on joyfully.  &ldquo;Awes seek out those strong and confident, no? We shall be a beacon for your people... we shall welcome you all. We shall never run out of paint for our bellies.&rdquo;   As his stomach squelched and worked up on me, slowly digesting me and the alcohol, I wondered idly what my symbol looked like. I was going to ask, but Darters soothing rubbing paws drove me relax and listen to his body and his lofty goals. </p>
<div class="magic hidden">
<p>(As Darter watched the sunrise with sleepy eyes and a settled grumbling belly he felt a pleasant shudder go through him. The new paint on him was bright and itched slightly, but he knew better then to scratch it.  Somewhere far east, a similar shudder swept through as a calling wakes in numerous hearts.  Darter and The Lanaga would come to find themselves very busy in the coming years. There would at least be no need for foraging.)</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div class="nodigest hidden">
<div class="darterVore hidden">
<p>I give him my reply by kicking out with a foot, eliciting a loud pained 'ooof' from the young Gryph. I then arch my back and twist sideways, stretching the stomach chamber awkwardly further, making Darter groan and clutch at his belly. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't get ahead of yourself!&rdquo; I grunt and grit my teeth as I push against the confines of his body and surrounding muscles. Its a fight I appear to be winning, as the chamber loosens and grruurrggs in a pained upset manner. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, stop! Please!&rdquo; whines the Chief-Son, as he holds on and winces.</p>

<p>I use my training, the one everyone questions whether they'd ever need back in the academy. I bunch of my legs underneath me, shift around to get a feel of whats up and whats down and then straighten my body. </p>

<p>Darters stomach has enough, it releases me quickly and I'm hastily expelled from the beak of a teary-eyed Darter who staggers back from me with a moan.</p>

<p>I make sure to stand up quickly, despite having saliva slicked fur I make sure to project an air of steely displeasure. </p>

<p>&ldquo;That was not part of any deal of ours! You think I'd fall for such juvenile temptations?&rdquo; I scold them all.  Forager Holixer seem to capability to look both remorseful and furious (at Darter) at the same time. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course Captain! My ward overstepped his bounds. This was about proving trustworthiness and we failed our part. &ldquo; He bowed his head to me and the other attending Gryphs around, hesitantly followed suit. </p>
<div class="island hidden">
<p>&ldquo;I will return to my ship now. Scout Vessla will accompany me. Our deal is done.&rdquo; I announce curtly and turn to leave. </p>

<p>With Holixer having bowed his head to my authority and Chief-Son Darter laying curled up with a severe stomach-ache, there was no question of obedience from anyone.  Scout Vessla fell in, though eyeing back at Darter with sympathetic sadness.  </p>
</div>
<div class="ship hidden">
<p>"I believe this concludes our business. Scout Vessla is staying with us now, our deal is done." I announce curtly, making it clear their welcome is over. </p>

<p>With Holixer having bowed his head to my authority, helping along Chief-Son Darter who whined and clutched a severe stomach-ache, there was no question of obedience from anyone.  Scout Vessla stayed as the Gryphs made to leave, though looking to Darter with sadness. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="holixerVore hidden">
<p>I come to awake to a jostling movement. My head is fuzzy as it seems I have dozed off in my moment of being at ease inside Holixers belly. I'm not certain how long its been and I silently curse those Aweish instincts to peacefully submit to a body around you. </p>

<p>It seems however that my trust was well-placed, the churn of muscles around me I feel are not those of a stomach at work, but the convulsions of one working to disgorge its contents. </p>

<p>Im shunted back up the throat of Holixer, soon feeling the cold air around my feet as I appear in the same manner I went down.  Strong arms and steady paws catch me and I suddenly find myself held in Holixers embrace as I extract my head from his open beak and meet his smiling eyes. </p>

<p>&ldquo;All of you intact and well, Captain? Looks like it.&rdquo; He rumbles jovially. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye... I feel good.&rdquo; I reply and don't realize my admission until a brief pause passes. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear Captain.&rdquo; Holixer sets me down on my feet gently and straightens up, paws on his hips. My fur is slick with saliva and goop, but it seems Holixer has had foresight for this <div class="island hidden"> and there are some rudimentary cleaning tools and clean water ready.  We appear to be alone in some manner of small groomery of sorts, but its not the same hut that I climbed inside Holixer in.</div><div class="island hidden">there is a fresh bath cleaning tools ready nearby. He appears to have taken it upon himself to ask someone to draw a bath for me in my chambers. </p>

<p>&quot;Your young little servants are quite diligent and efficient.&quot; The big Gryph grinned bemused.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;With this I reckon you've proven your good intent and trustworthiness more then amply.&rdquo; Holixer spoke. &ldquo;Chief-Son Darter will chafe at letting Vessla go, he enjoys people and objects from outside our isles, but he will honor this deal too. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Before long I join the rest of the group outside, some of my anxious crew visibly relieved at my return.  Scout Vessla too, seems less apprehensive. He is clearly not thrilled about leaving, <div class="ship hidden">but he watches the Gryph depart quietly. The Lanaga tribe depart our ship amicably. As they climb into their canoes I meet Holixers gaze briefly and he has nothing but a knowing warm smile to give as he pats his chest with a closed fist. </div><div class="island hidden"> but he comes along without further objection. The Gryphs escort us back and we part with Tribe Lanaga amicably.  As we row back to the ship I meet Holixers gaze briefly and he has nothing but a knowing warm smile to give as he pats his chest with a closed fist.</div> He's keeping a little part of something of mine.  Perhaps I can somewhat sympathize with what Scout Vessla saw in these people.</p>
</div>

<div class="vesslaVore hidden">
<p>&ldquo;You should be better in shape, don't you Scouts need to be trained and ready for any eventuality.&rdquo; I berate the Scout from inside his belly, giving a little thump. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah.. nhf... yes. Well... I can fly, climb, track and even swim as good as the best...! I've just... left eating to others....&rdquo; Vessla winced in reply. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, its time to let me out Scout. I don't have patience for dallying.&rdquo; I command firmly. Even from inside him, I have to ensure there are no questions of who's in command. He's going to be working for me after this, so best not give him ideas. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes Captain, okay... &ldquo; The Scout shifted and moved. I felt him push against me as he crawled out of<div class="island hidden"> his hut</div><div class="ship hidden">my bed</div> to get more space. Paws pushed against me and he heaved, but all in the wrong ways.  He seemed to lack the technique or know-how in how to get me back up and I was smooshed this way and that as the Scout tried to cough me up. </p>

<p>It was not until I heard the burr of Holixers voice that things improved.  &ldquo;Here, let me aid you Vessla. You need to relax and then, open wide.&rdquo; </p>

<p>The Gryph squeezed an arm down Vesslas gullet and then helped the scout activate the right reflex.  The journey back was quicker then down, perhaps aided thanks to Holixer who literally yanked me out of Vesslas jaws in one smooth swoop once he got a hold of me. It seemed not much easier on the Scout, who ended up coughing and gasping.  It seemed some Awes were not suited to take on others. I pitied him slightly.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="flirty hidden">
<p>“Humour me captain, with a few indulgent questions of mine.” Darter smirked and leaned himself closer to my person. <br />
“Ofcourse.” I replied. <br />
“I will be honest, you are most fascinating to me. I heard you Awes were a matriarchal society, but in my mind before I met you, I just imagined you'd be like particularly headstrong hens.” Chief-Son Darter chuckled but he was quick add words after seeing my brow furrow. <br />
“Ah, hen is an affectionate term! I mean not to sound condecening of our female counterparts, but female Gryphs we keep protected in our main village, they are more delicate of build and often with egg. The rigours of foraging, hunting and fighting are left to us males.”<br />
“What is your question?” I asked calmly and patiently.<br />
“How do you Awes pick mates for yourselves? Is it the females who have to show off their prowess to impress a male into choosing them?” <br />
I sighed slightly but answered. “Females choose the male when they feel ready and willing to carry young. They pick whomever strikes their whim.”<br />
“Interesting! And males have no say in the matter? No way to impress or sway a female to pick them?” <br />
“Sure, a female can become enamoured with a particularly capable male. Whats the point of these questions?”<br />
“Ah yes well then, do you find me at all attractive? Say, in a theoretical sense, would you possibly ever find yourself enamoured with me?” Darters eyes looked deep into mine, beak spread into a slow smile.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div class="appeal2 hidden">

<div class="perhaps hidden">
<p>“It could happen.” I shrugged neutrally<br />
“Interesting! Intruiging!” Darter exclaimed, grinning triumphantly. </p>
</div>

<div class="no hidden">
<p>“No, dont flatter yourself!” I snorted. It was best to be firm. <br />
“Hah, rough with your rejections. Hens are alike.” Darter chuckled, poorly trying to hide how his pride took a thorn. </p>
</div>

<div class="stare hidden">
<p>I give Darter a long stare. He returns it in silence, but gives up first, holding up his hands in surrender. <br />
“One must ask, or forever suffer in doubt. It seems I must suffer.”</p>
</div>

<div class="favor hidden">
“I have asked a lot of questions of my friend Vessla about your culture and customs. But I feel like there is a unique opportunity and perspective to learn from with you Captain. Why dont you stay the night and we can talk more in private. I would consider this a great favor to me and my tribe. Surely there is no hurry that cant wait a night?“ Darter smiled and winked. </p>

<p>I consider his offer a moment. The Chief-Son of Lanaga probably fancies himself quite a charmer. <br />
I could stay the night and endure his questions and possible advances. </p>
</div>

<div class="nofavor hidden">
“Well, you are an interesting people. It might had been interesting to talk more about your culture and customs, but night encroaches and I shall keep you no longer. You may leave now.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="stay hidden">
<p>“Oh, Excellent!” The Islander Chief grinned. “I find your captain quite reasonable and agreeable Vessla.” The Chief-Son patted the scout on the back gently. “I've enjoyed your stay with us, you are welcome to return when able, but Im sure you will be safe among them and your worries unfounded. </p>

<p>The Scout looked defeated, his wings drooping for a moment before he nodded, seeming to wisely accept the cirumstances. </p>

<p>“Yes... I suppose... you are right. T-thank you for your hospitality. I hope I'll be able to return.” </p>

<p>The scout returned to the ship shortly after with the rest of my reluctant delegation. <br />
The invitation to stay in the village only stretched to me alone. </p>

<p>I was not particularly worried. One night of indulging a young Islander prince with whatever fancied questions and coversations he wished to have was a small price to pay. <br />
If he dared to overstep his bounds with me, I would just...</p>
</div>

<div class="nostay hidden">
<p>&ldquo;I must decline the offer.&rdquo; I try to answer as kindly as I can. Though there really was no diplomatic easy way to turn down the Chief-Son without offending him. </p>

<p>Darter leans back, looking disappointed. Royalty like him no doubt are rarely snubbed.  &ldquo;I'm saddened to hear that. It was an opportunity for our relations to bond and strengthen.&rdquo; </p>

<p>I can only sigh quietly. It would not be appropriate for me to stay the night alone in this village, no matter how innocent I kept it.  Forager Holixer seems to shrug and fix us our group with a neutral gaze. The Chief Son has spoken, we reached the end of this approach to gain their favor.</p>
</div>


<div class="firm hidden">
<p>As my retinue reluctantly has left back to the ship for the night, the tribe prince swoops in to my side to show me around the quaint little village. It was amusing to watch him hover closely around me, dotting upon my needs while he chatted amicably for a while at first. <br />
As darkness fell he resolutely invited me to the guest quarters in his own sizable (In comparison to the rest of the village) house. <br />
Darter might think he's charmed me, for he seemed resolutely convinced by his own ego that I would welcome his advances once his straying paws started to become a little too friendly. I had to put my foot down.</p>

<p>“If you are so interested in us Awes, me in particular, you must accept you will be playing by our rules.” I warned him while firmly pushing him to arms-length. He seemed not deterred, rather he seemed almost inflamed by it. </p>

<p>“Delightful! Perhaps you can teach me more!” He begged of me while trying to envelop his wings around me. </p>

<p>I knew I was not being entirely fair, but respect was best taught. <br />
“Male Awes know to wait for a females interest first, for otherwise they risk being firmly overwhelmed.”</p>

<p>Darter nodded enthusiastically, but in his ardour he did not see the warning. As he pressed himself close again I grasped him back in a much less passionate grip and yanked him to the ground. <br />
Darter managed to let out a squawk of surprise before my weight pinned him and I shoved my jaws over his beak and head. </p>

<p>He fluttered and kicked, but although his size matched mine, his strength was not on par. <br />
I swallowed firmly around his chin and felt him start his slide down my gullet. </p>

<p>It was the first time I ate a Gryph, I confess I had been quite curious about their taste. Their feathered bodies were not too unlike fur, Darters writhing body certainly had its own texture and exotic flavor. In the end, I confess, it was like swallowing down any other struggling body. Gryphs did not turn out to be as uniquely delicious as I'd hoped. </p>

<p>My belly swelled pleasantly as the Lanaga prince was squeezed into it, his muffled protests and twisting doing naught but delay his descent into my body. I had a brief chuckle at the way he was trying to call for attention or help by tapping his clawed feet against the ground. </p>

<p>In the end, said feet were slurped up, briefly licked over for lubricated and easy swallowing and then... Glck. Chief-Son Darter was all in my belly. </p>

<p>I stood up and licked my chops, waiting for him to settle inside the sagging furred dome of my gut. I gave him a few reassuring pats as his complaints turned fearful and whiny. </p>

<p>“Sorry Darter, I have to reject your advances. You were being much too pushy and needed this lesson in Awe courtship.”</p>

<p>I slowly ambled over to my mattress, it proved soft and comfortable enough and I sprawled down on top of my belly on it. </p>

<p>“We shall sleep together now, you and I. Just not the way you wanted. Come morning, perhaps you'll have gotten over yourself a little.”</p>

<p>I belched and yawned. The temptation to digest this upstart was of course there. I don't think however, that I was in a position to get away with that much. You are also supposed to have a chance to learn from lessons.</p>
</div>

<div class="amused hidden">
<p>As my retinue reluctantly has left back to the ship for the night, the tribe prince swoops in to my side to show me around the quaint little village. It was amusing to watch him hover closely around me, dotting upon my needs while he chatted amicably about the village and the challenges of maintaining it. </p>

<p>He's very enthusiastic and proud and light boasts in attempts to impress me are endearing in a way. </p>

<p>As darkness fell he invited me to the guest quarters in his own sizable (In comparison to the rest of the village) house. <br />
As he shows off his room and the guest room, he has a confident attitude about him. He seems so sure in his ego that he has managed to charm me. I let him think that he has, bemused by his strutting about and subtle gentle touches of contact. </p>

<p>“You know Avolc. I offered this to Scout Vessla, I'd really like to give you a special wing massage, but he was very protective of them. Would you let me try? They are so alike to ours but different, I'd love to feel them over.” Darter asked in earnest. </p>

<p>It seemed like an innocent enough offer. Unlike the Scouts, I had no need to be as paranoid about my wings. <br />
Soon enough I lay stretched out on my bedding while Darters expert paws gently pulled and kneaded the limbs of my wings. <br />
It was luxuriously comfortable, he was very good at it. I found myself relaxing deeply soon enough and did not, could not, object when those rubbing paws strayed away from the wings and onto my back. </p>

<p>Come morning, I awaken wrapped up in Darters arms, tucked in under his chin. I feel a moment of startled rush unrecognition to my whereabouts before memory returns. </p>

<p>I gather my things, dress and head back toward the ship without waking the Gryph tribe prince.</p>
</div>

<div class="formal hidden">
<p>As my retinue reluctantly has left back to the ship for the night, the tribe prince swoops in to my side to show me around the quaint little village.<br />
He is obviously flirting, but I make a point early on not to respond to any of it or brush off any touch of his without being too brusque.</p>

<p>As darkness fell he invited me to the guest quarters in his own sizable (In comparison to the rest of the village) house. <br />
Darter is not blind to the standoffish behavior of mine, but not entirely put off. </p>

<p>“So Captain Avolc. I've shown you all there is to show about the village here, its not as grand as our main village back on Lanaga isle, but im proud of it.” Darter beamed.</p>

<p>“It's a very cozy place. Sheltered and comfortable despite being so far out at sea.” I reply. </p>

<p>“I'm sorry the guest-room is so small. If you'd like, you're welcome to stay in my room with me.” The prince crooned. </p>

<p>I had been expecting it and smiled slightly while holding up my paw. <br />
“Thank you for the offer, but this room will suffice. Thank you for the tour and feast Darter. I'd like to retire for the night now. I will see you tomorrow before I leave.” </p>

<p>Darter looked struck down and his wings and ears drooped slightly at my rejection. I was uncertain of Gryph body language, but his disappointment was obvious enough. I was less certain how the prince would handle not getting what he wanted. </p>

<p>“Are you sure?” He asked, sounding baffled. </p>

<p>“Yes Darter. Apologies, you're not my type.”</p>

<p>“V-very well... Good night then, Captain.” He looked very deflated, unused perhaps to rejection and turned and left stoically and I let out a quiet sigh once he was gone.</p>

</div>

<div class="threaten hidden"><p><strong>Threaten</strong></p>
<p>“Scout Vessla, I'm sure I don't have to tell you what the law for desertion is.” Before he can answer I give a hard slap to the gut under my belt without breaking my gaze with him.</p>

<p>Vessla visibly gulps nervously, but Forager Holixer seems to straighten and clack his beak briefly, coming to the scouts defense. “Threats are not to be made lightly Awe-Captain!”</p>

<p>I would not let myself be intimidated however.</p>

<p>“Scout Vessla abandoning his duty at this point would hurt our cause with more then just his absence. It sets a dangerous precedent that threaten the crews conviction and dedication.” I slammed a clenched paw on the table. “You are here for the defense of the homeland! Not to find a place of refuge! So I can only offer him the ONE way out everyone else gets." </p>
<!--And I assure you there will be very little lightness about me if you interfere and force me to fit all three of you!”-->
<div class="armed hidden">
<p>They seemed to take my threat quite seriously, shifting uncertainly, but the Chief-son Darter looked noticeably agitated.</p>
</div>
<div class="unarmed hidden">
<p>My threat puts them on edge, but they look more offended then they do threatened. Scout Vessla and Darter exchanges glances with one another. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="success hidden"><p><strong>Lanaga convinced to return scout.</strong></p>
<p>
Forager Holixer, the large Islander Gryph, puts a hand on Scout Vesslas shoulder. <br />
“Perhaps your Captain speaks sense.” <br />
The Scout seems to tense and turns on him, baffled. So did Chief-Son Darter. <br />
Darter makes to speak a loud objection when Forager Holixer asserts his authority by spreading his wings wide and slamming a fist into the table. Whatever hierarchy they have seems to assert itself, but not without the Chief-Son visibly fuming. <br />
Bafflement turns to defeat as Forager Holixers stern face remains resolute. <br />
“I approved welcoming you because you wished for refuge and your fear seemed genuine. Captain Avolc here seems honorable in her cause however.” Holixer spoke.<br />
“You're kicking me out?” Scout Vessla squeaked. <br />
“You are welcome to return once your duty to your people is served, Vessla of Lanaga. As long as Captain Avolc promises to treat your fairly and not lay undue punishment upon you.” </p>

<p>I assure them with my word, that Scout Vesslas behavior would be overlooked as long as he served faithfully. That he'd be allowed to return too when his service was over. <br />
This seemed to ease a lot of the worries in the Scouts face. But his wings and ears drooped as he accepted the outcome, he was visibly not a happy Awe.</p>
</div>
<div class="success2 hidden"><p><strong>Convinced to rejoin willingly</strong></p>
<p>
Scout Vessla seemed to sigh, deflate almost. Then he took a long breath and straightened back up again. <br />
“Very well Captain. I... understand. I apologize also, I have not acted in accordance of our ways. I will return with you and fulfill my duties.” He exchanged glances with Chief-Son Darter and there was a slight sorrow there between them it seemed. <br />
“If that is your choice, Vessla. We shall await your return.” Forager Holixer spoke, but his eyes were on me. He had a stern face, but they seemed approving. <br />
“Very good. I'm glad this settled amicably. Welcome to the crew of the 'Attentive' Scout Vessla.”</p>
</div>

<div class="success3 hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>I return to the ship at dawn, escorted through the island and to a waiting boat by a small delegation of Gryphs that had attached themselves to me as a sort of honor guard. </p>

<p>Activity on the ship is just about waking up, but I do find my First officer with a cadre of armed Awes and Raptorians anxiously waiting for me, ready to enter the island if my arrival was in any way delayed. </p>

<p>I reassure them everything has gone well and wisely I'm not asked for details. No doubt it'll be a topic for gossip no matter what I said occurred. </p>

<p>Scout Vessla has been debriefed in my absence and he has rejoined the Scouts under Scout-Master Krel leadership. </p>

<p>I'm informed he has been quite forthcoming. He has said the likely direction to finding the fleet is further west. That was the fleets last heading and where they had previously operated. </p>

<p>He also informed that Lanaga tribe had been worried about a outer island of theirs being occupied by a whole lot of Gators of unknown affiliation to the north.   If it was a nest of potential pirates, it could be the fleet have already been there and cleared them out. It was another potential source for answers.</p>

<p>We can head further West and follow the clues of the Fleets trail. </p>

<p>Or we can head north to investigate the island with a potential pirate encampment on it. </p>

<div class="notVisited hidden">
<p>There is also the South-Eastern Navpoint and marked as a resupply point, but its a bit of a trip in the opposite direction.</p>

</div>


<div class="failed hidden"><p><strong>Failed Negotiation</strong></p>
<p>The Gryphs have had enough. Chief-son Darter rises from his seat, clacking at the floor with his claws. It seems he has lost patience with these discussions. Either they do not trust us or we somehow offended them, its unclear.</p>

<p>“Points of view have been exchanged. But now I have heard enough and ask you to depart and leave me and mine in peace.” The Gryph places an arm around Vessla firmly and possessively. “I was told you Awes are honorable and reasonable. I trust there will be no contention and conflict.”</p>

<p>Forager Holixer rises along with the Chief-son. I've puzzled together that he is the protector of the Tribe-Prince and no doubt of some authority, he appears more torn but he offers no argument and stands with Darter. It seems that Scout Vessla bows to his authority as well and follows suite. </p>
</div>

<div class="failed2 hidden"><p><strong>Failed Negotiation</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Vesslas fears are true then, your tribe do not trade fairly and threaten with strength.&rdquo; Darter spat the words. &ldquo;Be gone captain, leave this place! I banish you! Vessla is Lanaga now and under our protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ground my teeth, unable to hide my displeasure at their gal. Instinctively my paw shifted closer to the hilt of my blade. If I drew here however, my prospects of success were slim, their numbers were just too great.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will permit to your departure in peace Captain. But return not with your warriors, my tribe know these woods and though you may conquer us it will not be without feeling our sting and bite!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know not what forces you court conflict with.&rdquo; I warned firmly. I eyed Scout Vessla sharply once more, who shrunk away under my gaze. He seemed ashamed and fearful, as he should be. However, he backed away deeper into the tribe rather than making any moves to join me.</p>

<p>I fumed all the way back to my ship, not speaking a word for the whole trip. My small accompanying delegation were wise to remain equally silent.</p>

<p>Once back on the ship, my officers looked to me for orders. </p>

<p>We could call it quite and leave, I know a few of my officers would like to advice it but are wary of my ire. </p>

<p>I could also make truth of my threat and have a force ready to head into the village to arrest the Scout. </p>
<div class="garschText hidden">
<p> With the narrow and difficult passage through the woods however, it'd be a difficult task </p>
</div>
<div class="nyxieText hidden">
<p> With their main entrance discovered, I could safely send a pretty sizable force to do it. </p>

<p> Lastly, there's the Scouts. I could ask them to try to grab our scout covertly. If they have the element of surprise thats a task well within their trained abilities. It's a fellow scout i'd be asking them to kidnap however.</p>

<div class="apprehend hidden"><p><strong>Apprehend Vessla</strong></p>
<p>“You are free to leave.” I tell the two Gryphs. But then nod toward the Scout firmly. </p>

<p>“But Scout Vessla is staying with us. Willing or not, I will not permit him to desert his duty until released from service. I'm sorry if this will cause issue between us, but we at the Admiralty take responsibility seriously.”</p>

<p>Guards who had been standing outside step into the room, swords sheathed but at their sides. A Raptorian looms in the corridor outside. Its an unfortunate precaution and show of force I had hoped it would not have come to.</p>

<p>Both the Gryphs visibly tense and plumage rises in outrage. But before anything escalates further Vessla calls out.</p>

<p>“Wait! There's no need for violence! I will submit. I will fall in line, just nobody needs to get hurt.”</p>

<p>I nod firmly and the tension drains out of the room. It seems Scout Vessla has some reason in him after all. But Chief-Son Darter looks extremely displeased by our heavy-handedness, even as I offer an olive branch as we part ways and they leave the ship for their canoes.</p>

<p>“Scout Vessla will be allowed to return once his service is completed. If things go well in our anti-pirating efforts around these seas, that might be sooner then you think.”</p>

<p>“The Lanaga will remember the way you shackle your own to duty. We shall be careful in our deals with you.”</p>

“I've heard your pleas but enough is enough, Scout Vessla is coming with us.” I spoke as firmly as possible. The Gryphs tensed and a hush swept through the table and then the village in forbearance of possible confrontation. <br />
“Willing or not, I will not permit him to desert his duty until released from service. If this causes issue between us, I apologize, however we at the Admiralty take responsibilities seriously.” <br />
There is movement around us. Islanders are bunching up, wielding spears and harpoons. My armed escort draw swords and the Raptorians scratch ground with their claws in anticipation. <br />
Chief-Son Darter is visibly outraged, plumage ruffling and Forager Holixer is slowly pulling him backward, getting him out of harms way.<br />
“Wait! There's no need for violence! I will submit! I will fall in line, just... nobody needs to get hurt.”<br />
The tension holds only briefly before dissipating. I make a point of further breaking it by waving my escort to sheathe their weapons. It seems Scout Vessla had some reason in him after all. <br />
“Very good.” I nod firmly. “Scout Vessla will be allowed to return once his service is completed. If things go well, that might be sooner then you think.” <br />
The Lanaga however were not pleased with my heavy-handed show of force. Chief-Son Darter expresses his displeasure clearly and will not hear anything more from me as I try to ease the situation.<br />
“The Lanaga will remember the way you shackle your own to duty. We shall be careful in our deals with you.”</p>
</div>

“Willing or not, I will not permit him to desert his duty until released from service.

<div class="questionV hidden"><p><strong>Question Vessla</strong></p>
<p>Vessla has been captured, for whatever reasons he's chosen to side with the native inhabitants and abandon his duty to the Admiralty. I have a lot of questions for him, perhaps I can figure out his reasons before I decide upon his fate. </p>

<div class="assault hidden">
Awes were hurt in his retrieval and the village largely destroyed in their opposition, so its best we get as much information out of him as possible to make it worthwhile. </p>

</div>
<div class="kidnap2 hidden">
<p>We managed to retrieve him covertly without anyone getting hurt. No doubt the natives will be angry with us, but they'd be wise to not interfere. </p>
</div>
<p> Its a defeated and forlorn looking Scout that sits curled up in his seat in the brig. <div class="assault hidden">He does not seem to acknowledge my arrival, he just stares blankly at an empty spot ahead of him. </div></p>

 <div class="assault hidden">
<p>&ldquo;Scout Vessla.&rdquo; His spoken name seems to rouse him and he meets my gaze. &ldquo;I need some answers out of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Scout remained sullen throughout my questions. It seemed some of his spirit had gone out of him. Perhaps it was resignation or guilt or a mix of both. Either way he answered with some useful information, though not as in depth as I would have liked, despite my urgings for leniency if he cooperated. </p>

<p> Armed: The Tribe he had been living with were the Lanaga. This was one of their satellite foraging villages.  Though he would not fully divulge his reasoning for doing so, he said he had decided to stay here, feeling at home and welcome with the natives. </p>

<p>It seemed to me the dangers and rigours of serving the Admiralty had perhaps become too much for him. How he had managed to graduate as a scout with such a cowardly attitude was beyond me. </p>

<p>An interesting clue he did manage to divulge about local pirate activity was that the tribe was worried about one of their outer islands being occupied by a whole lot of Gators of unknown affiliation. </p>

<p>That seems a promising source for more answers. A nest of potential pirates not too far north of here, could be the fleet have already been there and cleared them out. </p>
</div>


<div class="kidnap2 hidden">
<p>Scout Vessla eyed me nervously as I approached. He seemed a skittish sort, I wondered idly how one such as he made it through Scout training. I thought squeezed all the fear out of their male recruits. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Scout Vessla, I need some answers out of you, so you best be as forthcoming as possible.&rdquo; I sat down opposite of him and he seemed to nod briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes... Captain. I... apologize for my actions. I was foolish!&rdquo; Vessla squeaked repentantly. But it remained to be seen if he was just saying what he thought I wanted to hear. </p>

<p>Scout Vessla seemed to do his best to answer my questions and divulged all that he could about the Tribe he had been living with and what he knew of the surrounding area and the fleet. </p>

<p>The tribe was called the Lanaga. This was one of their satellite foraging villages, inhabited currently by a troop of foragers and a Chief-son and his guard.  He had been sent here to briefly make contact and make inroads in negotiating their future cooperation with the Admiralty.  During his time there he had grown attached and fond of their hospitable nature.  Scout Vessla expressed a sense of unease about the direction of the leadership of the fleet as his reluctance to return. His excuses were vague and seemed mostly based on cowardice to me. </p>

<p>&ldquo;The Admiral, she's so ruthlessly driven in defeating the enemy. A scout knows when its best to back down from an impossible fight. With so many unknowns we're facing, with the new weapons and enemies numbers, she has no such inhibitions.&ldquo;</p>

<p>He explained. It did not justify his attempted desertion of duties, though it did provide insight into whats been going on.  As for the fleets location, Scout Vessla informed the likely direction to find them is further west. That was the fleets last heading and where they had previously operated. </p>

<p>He also informed that Lanaga tribe had been worried about an outer island of theirs being occupied by a whole lot of Gators of unknown affiliation to the north.   If it was a nest of potential pirates, it could be the fleet have already been there and cleared them out. It was another potential source for answers. </p>
</div>

<p>As for what to do with Scout Vessla. The punishment for desertion was clear. </p>
<div class="kidnap2 hidden">
<p>Vessla has however been forthcoming enough and seems repentant about his actions. He could also be reinstated as a Scout. They are valuable assets so I could overlook this incident once with a hard warning about no tolerance toward future disobedience. </p>
</div>

<div class="assault hidden">
<p>Though he could be forcibly reinstated into the scouts, it's a hard question if he harbors any loyalty for the Admiralty and his fellow Awes anymore. </p>
</div>


<div class="questionV2 hidden"><p><strong>Question Vessla</strong></p>
<p>Vessla has been apprehended successfully without major incident.  It seemed the Gryph Tribe was ready to defend him with arms, which was quite surprising.  So its a good thing, for them, that Scout Vessla gave up right away and defused the situation.</p>

<p> They let their displeasure be known, especially that spoiled Chief-Son. It is unlikely we will be at slight disadvantage dealing with Lanaga in the future. </p>

<p>Scout Vessla now sits in for some extra questioning before I decide his fate. I could easily charge the Scout with charges as heavy as desertion for refusing to fall in line right away. I've certainly threatened to eat Awes for less in the past.</p>

<p>For now, he seems compliant and cooperative. Perhaps being back among his own kind and being firmly reminded of his duties has snapped him back from his folly. </p>

<p>He claims to be unsure of the whereabouts of the fleet, but divulges about local pirate activity was that the tribe was worried about. One of their outer forage islands is being occupied by a whole lot of Gators of unknown affiliation. </p>

<p>That seems a promising source for more answers. A nest of potential pirates not too far north of here, could be the fleet have already been there and cleared them out.</p>

<p>Only issue that remains is to decide what to do with Vessla now. He appears compliant now and i could assign him to Scout-Master Krel to be put back into duty. Their training and abilities make them valuable assets one can never have enough of.</p>
<p>Or on another hand, I can make an example out of him. His actions have not been that of a model sailor of the Admiralty and no one regardless of value and position are above their duties and Admiralty law. </p>

<div class="eatVessla hidden"><p><strong>Eat Vessla</strong></p>
<p>The Questions are over, there is no point in delaying things any further. </p>

<p>Vessla listens anxiously as I announce his verdict. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Scout Vessla, for your failure to report to duty as requested, you are charged with desertion.  Dire as circumstances are, I cannot permit such actions to go unpunished. You are hereby sentenced to be rations, carried out immediately.&rdquo; I give my belly a firm pat, letting him know of his destination, if it wasn't obvious enough.</p>

<p>The scout gulps nervously, eyes locked on my stomach as I step up close. He makes no move to resist, instinctively stunned in place under the authority of a female. </p>

<p>He's thin and light, he's easily enough hoisted up and shoved head first into my mouth. He takes hardly much effort to swallow down, letting out only a faint squeak and 'mmmph' as I swallow his shoulders and pull him down to his waist. His large prominent wings tickle my nose as they slide past, but they fold themselves close to his body without a hitch.</p>

<p>My stomach swells and my belt strains as he fills my stomach out. Its a comforting feeling, the weight, the stretch and the tickle of moist fur. His legs and feet paws vanish down my gullet without so much as a kick. In this, it seemed Scout Vessla at least knew his place. </p>

<p>A satisfied deep 'Grurrrgh' echoes from my belly as the meal settles in. A skinny scout is hardly much of a meal as far as devouring a person goes, but my belt does beg for some loosening and I comply. </p>

<p>Before the lethargy of feeding settles in, I have to decide upon our next destination. </p>

<p>The brown furred scout gulps nervously but remains quiet, awaiting my judgement. </p>

<p>&ldquo;However as you've been forthcoming and repentant, I may consider overlooking this particular incident for now. You are to report to Scout-Master Krel and his troop and resume your duties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scout Vessla looked surprised. His ears seemed to perk and eyes widen with slight astonishment. His shrunken posture unravelling slightly. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep in mind that we will have our eyes on you. Remember this favor as you remember your sworn duties.&rdquo; I locked eyes with him firmly. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes captain! I shall remember! I shall... serve&rdquo; The scout bowed his head and kept it so until I left. <br/> I have to decide upon our next destination. </p>

<p>Either way, my promise to the Islanders had to stand. Scout Vessla will avoid punishment for his behavior, though normally such actions would meet harsch judgement, my belly will have to wait and see for if he screws up again. </p>

<p>Its a slightly sullen and defeated scout which answers questions about the Fleet later. But he is cooperative and remorseful enough in tone to not rouse any ire. He's smart enough to know he's come close being 'retired'.</p>

<p>As for the fleets location, Scout Vessla informed the likely direction to find them is further west, marking one of the older rendezvous spots on the map.

<p>We part with the islander tribe of Lanaga, appropriately humbled, but on amicable terms. They even provide us a basket of foraged dried fruits and nuts as a parting gift.  My actions in submitting to their terms of visiting a belly seemed like a small price to pay for favorable relations and the peaceful return of our Scout.  I doubt all problems can be solved this way, but it worked out well this time. The crew will talk of course, it's just something I have to accept.  Some will approve of my willingness go out on a limb for a fellow Awe. Others might have preferred a sterner paw.</p>

<p>Either way, my promise to the Islanders had to stand. Scout Vessla will avoid punishment for his behavior, though normally such actions would meet harsh judgement, my belly will have to wait and see for if he screws up again to return some favors. </p>

<p>As for the fleets location, Scout Vessla informed the likely direction to find them is further west, marking one of the older rendezvous spots on the map. That was the fleets last heading and where they had previously operated.<div class="confirmtext hidden"> This location seems to match and confirm the information we uncovered on the beach of Navpoint 2. </div> </p>

<p>He also informed that Lanaga tribe had been worried about a outer island of theirs being occupied by a whole lot of Gators of unknown affiliation to the north.   If it was a nest of potential pirates, it could be the fleet have already been there and cleared them out. It was another potential source for answers. </p>

<p> I have to decide upon our next destination. </p>

<p>We can head further West and follow the clues of the Fleets trail. </p>

<p>Or we can head north to investigate the island with a potential pirate encampment on it.</p>

<div class="notVisited hidden">
<p>There is also the South-Eastern Navpoint and marked as a resupply point, but its a bit of a trip in the opposite direction.</p>

<p> We just need to keep heading deeper into the Thousand Isles. </p>

<div class="consider4 hidden"><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>We part with the Islanders and our wayward Scout, they are pleased with the peaceful resolution and have provided us with all available information they know about the fleets heading and other points of interest.  Im sure the Admiralty would have a lot to say about my decision to leave the scout here, that's a discussion for another day however and I'm the one appointed to making decisions here right now. </p>

<div class="consider5 hidden"><p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>
<p>We part with the Islanders along with our wayward Scout, they are pleased with the peaceful resolution and have provided us with the information they know about the fleets heading and other points of interest, it was not much but perhaps it will come to use. Chief-Son Darter and Scout Vessla exchange words in private, from a distance neither look particularly happy.</p>

<p>Scout Vessla was later much more forthcoming with valuable information. He guessed the likely direction to find the fleet is further west, marking one of the older rendezvous spots on the map. That was the fleets last heading and where they had previously operated. <div class="confirmtext hidden">This location seems to match and confirm the information we uncovered on the beach of 'Three sons' at Navpoint 2. </div></p>

<p>
<p>We are none the wiser about whereabouts of our fleet, this run in with the second wayward scout of the fleet has not been more reassuring then the first. </p>

<p>I have to decide upon our next destination. </p>

<p>There is the South-Eastern Navpoint marked as a resupply point, its a bit of a trip in the opposite direction. But seeing as we have few other leads, perhaps its where we need to go.</p>

<p>We can head further West and try follow the clues of the Fleets trail <div class="confirmtext hidden">that we uncovered on Navpoint 2</div> and see where we end up. Either way we just need to keep heading deeper into the Thousand Isles. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="consider7 hidden"><p><strong>Deliberations</strong></p>
<p>This encounter ended poorly, negotiations were unsuccessful and the Scout absconded with the Islanders. Whatever cooperation the Admiralty had hoped to achieve here will have to be attempted with another Tribe of Islanders.  I will make a note in my log of this region being potentially hostile in the future.</p>
