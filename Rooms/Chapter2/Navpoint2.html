<p>We sail by many smaller yet forested islands. We are still at the edges of Thousand islands but already I'm starting to understand where this sea got its name. </p>

<p>They are craggy islands with the kind of tough vegetation that can survive being literally submerged by the harsh storms that can rage past these places. I'm none too impressed by the potential hospitality for anyone wishing to live out here, least of all build some kind of port. </p>

<p>As we approach our destination however, the island trio of 'Three sons' come into view well in the distance. Cliffs jut up high on the three islands and lush and diverse plant-life cling to these peaks, making them look like three thick green finger-digits. The three islands are in a sense one big island, they're clearly connected and at low-tide it would be possible to easily cross between them on foot. But right now the high-tides separate the three.</p>

<p>Its no doubt still a wet and windy place most times of the year, but life finds a way to cling to whatever stable place it can find.</p>

<p>It does not take long while circling the islands to find the beach that had seen recent use.</p>

<p>A bay with deep shallow let us sail in and anchor right close to he bay of the second most largest of the island trio. </p>

<p>Signs of the fleet having been here is everywhere. Abandoned make-shift shelters has been built amongst the woods and sections of trees have been cleared away in places and harvested for their wood judging by the remains of wood-chips and pulp. </p>

<p>Cut out trails of plenty of passage lead further into the island too, it looks almost as if the whole fleet had been trampling around on this beach. </p>

<p>Scouts report that the largest trail lead to an inland pool. Its nearly been drained of usable fresh water. Other trails likewise lead to smaller wells and one to a small natural clearing.</p>

<p>There are some signs of landing and passage on the closest smaller island too, but none to the extent of this island, its mostly been foraged for food.</p>

<p>The large island seems mostly untouched, but it also has less choosable landing spots and seem to consist mostly of slick cliffs and difficult terrain.</p>

<p> A cursory glance through the hastily erected but surprisingly firmly built shacks do not reveal much.</p>

<p> Little appear to have been left that couldn't be carried along. But perhaps someone with astute eyes and time can puzzle something together or find something. </p>

<p> The main objective here is to figure out clues about the whereabout of the fleet and what they may have left behind. </p> 

<p> Our secondary objective of finding an island suitable as a potential forward naval base for the Admiralty I deem of low priority. Like the majority of islands around Thousand Isles, the waters are very shallow all around these islands, making close approach by ship a difficult affair. </p>

Perhaps he sees the deployment and assignment as a chance to practise, or perhaps that's the only way to deploy that martial-minded Awe knows.</p>

<p>The Scouts might have performed a cursory check of the islands, but Tungs Awes make sure no stone is left unturned as they soon charge across the seemingly empty forests in search pattern formations.</p>

<p>The abandoned structures become a temporary base of operation, getting to house Tungs Awes and whatever goods the uncovered from the isles. So far, only some wild game. </p>

<p><span class="title"></span> Garschs troops assemble on the beach with efficiency.  They seem to take the time, assembling for a briefing and plan their investigation of the island. Most of them are armed lightly as Officer Garsch puts trust in the scout reports. In fact I think I see Scout-Master Krel at the beach himself, invited to take part in the planning, wings at rest under the protective black cloak which is units signature uniform.</p>

<p>They soon disperse over the islands, though some remain to poke around and reinforce shacks left from the islands previous Awe visitors.  I look forward to his report once he is done, it is likely to be as thorough as his deployment.</p>

<div class="water hidden"><p><strong>Pristine Water</strong></p>
<p>While my expedition team explores the island, I receive a quick report from their initial findings. <br>
Keeper and surprisingly Chef Zat presents it as a source of interest to our supplies.<br>
“Captain, as you know the local water sources are somewhat depleted from the previous visitors, but the landing parties report that there’s a larger fresh water source at the top of the peak of this island. It would take some extra crews and a little hard work, but you Awes are good climbers so it would not cost us more than a little extra effort from some extra landing parties. “ Said Keeper. <br>
“Is there a catch of some sort? Why have the landing parties not chosen to forage water from that one?” I asked<br>
“Well, there are some signs of a small trail leading up there and there are stone markings around it. We are not sure what they mean. As far as we know, no Islander tribe have made claim on this Island. Either way, there’s more than enough to go around up there.” Keeper replied.<br>
“Could the water be bad?” I quirk my head. <br>
“I thought of that and I have a sample here!” Keeper sloshed a small container. He always came prepared. Chef Zat perked up and spoke. <br>
“I’ve tested it and had it tasted, it seems very clean and fresh; Surprisingly pristine and delicious in fact! Water like this would be a very worthwhile trading commodity back in arid Wulflands, we’re a bit of water connoisseurs there.” <br>
“We’re not dragging water to the Wulf-lands.” I frowned. <br>
“Oh, hah, you misunderstand. It was just his way of indirectly telling you our arid originated Chef highly approves of the water and deems it highly drinkable.” Keeper chuckled. <br>
“We should replace our stores with it as much as possible, it’ll cheer up the crew from the stale stuff we have in the holds now.” Chef Zat filled in. <br>
“So the only problem is an old circle of stones.“ I crossed my arms. <br>
“Well yes, you Awes are a bit superstitious, so I thought it best to seek your approval.” Keeper nodded.</p>
</div>

<div class="wateryes hidden"><p><strong>Pristine Water</strong></p>
<p>I give permission to retrieve the water. To fill as many barrels as we can and even replace some of the less fresher ones. <br>
The peak and its height proved a insignificant challenge to the work-crews assigned for the job. In fact they seemed to like it and soon barrels of fresh pristine water were being hoisted aboard. <br>
I had a sip of the water myself and it did indeed taste very fresh and delicious. Like meltwater from the mountain streams of home. The crew with certainly approve.</p>
</div>

<div class="waterno hidden"><p><strong>Pristine Water</strong></p>
<p>We are not in any dire need of water so I don’t see why we should expend energy on this endeavour. <br>
Chef Zat is disappointed but in the end I have the final call on the matter. Believe what they will for my reasoning, superstitious or otherwise.</p>
</div>

<div class="cadetQ hidden"><p><strong>Cadet Quest</strong></p>
<p>The island presents a good opportunity to give the cadets some assignment and have them learn some lessons. This place seems largely uninhabited so its ideal to let them loose on it without them bumbling into too much trouble. <br>
I have two lessons in mind and have to make my mind up on one of them. <br>
 I could have them forage for food and supplies, see how well they combine their knowledge to gather us some extra barrels of rations. It might turn out to be a bit difficult, due to the nearby islands being picked clean from the previous visitors. Cooperation will be key. <br>
 <br>
Secondly, I could assign them a small command of a few hardy sailors and send them to explore the third and larger island. The scouts have not seen anything from the air, but a small team of extra eyes having a look at it to see what they uncover might be useful. It would be interesting to see if one of them takes command of the others, or if the three of them will be able to share the command.</p>
</div>
<div class="cadetQF hidden"><p><strong>Cadet Quest - Food forage</strong></p>
<p>“I expect you to fill all three of these barrels with some manner of fresh or otherwise edible produce that will pass Cooks inspection.”<br>
“Yes, Captain! Of course!” Glint saluted stiffly, eager to please and make up for their previous mischiefs.<br>
Two other two cadets equally stood silently, seeming to share their fellow cadets excitement. This would be a rare chance for them to have some autonomy and be away from the ship.<br>
But I suspected they didn't quite understand yet that it was no field trip they were being sent out upon.<br>
In a way I was setting them up to fail, they only had a day and the island, although dense, was small and seemed to contain mostly brambles and knotty old trees of the non-fruit bearing variety.<br>
But it would be interesting to see what they came up with, even if they ended up shoving each-other into the barrels.<br>
“You have a day, then I expect the barrels back right here on deck, full or with a damn good excuse!” I added quite some bite to my tone.<br>
“Yes, Captain!” All three saluted in unison, their fur bristling.<br>
“Get to it then, dismissed!” I watched them pause in hesitation, look at the barrels and then at the shore of the island not far from our anchored position. I raised my brow at them and they scrambled in confusion, grabbing a barrel each and rolling them aimlessly in separate directions before erupting in a chatter with each other.<br>
They would have to arrange transport to and fro the island on their own of course.</p>
</div>

<div class="cadetQFR hidden"><p><strong>Cadet Quest - Results</strong></p>
<p>Along with Chef Zat, I inspected the three barrels with a mild look of displeasure. They were far from full and seemed to mostly contain the most random assortment of goods I ever could have expected. One even had a something scampering around inside.<br>
“So this is what you claim will pass for foraged rations?” I looked up at the cadets arrayed in front of me. They looked a bit rough from not only a day of digging through brambles. They shifted their footing uncertainly.<br>
“What's this, why is this one half-full of just grass?” I tapped the first barrel.<br>
“I-its Sour-grass Captain.” Valnos spoke up. “You can boil it and drink the soup. Its... supposed to...”<br>
“It’s very low on nutrition, it’s gives you a bellyache and is really only a last resort kind of food to stave off starvation.” Chef Zat tapped the barrel, shaking his head. <br>
“I wouldn't even serve sour-grass soup to prisoners! Not unless I really enjoyed watching peoples faces shrivel up, but there are laws against that.” I huffed and Valnos looked down at his toes.<br>
“And this, someone explain this Cavy looking thing.” I tapped the side of the second barrel in question where some kind of stressed rodent was running in circles inside.<br>
“Thats mine!” Ziggy raised a paw enthusiastically. “I caught that! It’s a fat one!”<br>
“So you caught one miserable rodent for one or two sailor to sup on?” I raised a brow.<br>
“There's other stuff in there. Whole lot of Knot-berries!” Ziggy protested hesitantly, getting a little frustrated with this show.<br>
“You mean this trampled mush or these little brown pellets most of them have transformed into? It’s all contaminated now.” Chef Zat wrinkled his nose down at the contents of the barrel.<br>
“What...? Oh...” Ziggy pulled at her collar.<br>
“And don't get me started on this unholy mix of a mess in this one.” I tapped the third barrel, it was Glints turn to cringe, to her credit she remained silent. “Mushroom bits, twigs with berries, dirt with roots. What's this, Bark?”<br>
“For tea.” Glint squeaked silently.<br>
“Oh, how considerate! So the cook is just supposed to boil the whole barrel is he?”<br>
“There’s a little bit of everything in there, but again, it’s all mixed up. It would have to be emptied and sorted, which might take longer than gathering a new barrel. And much of this is unusable mush now. “ Chef Zat explained. <br>
The cadets all had the look on their faces now of where they thought me unfair. They had probably expected me to shower them with praise for filling up 3 barrels. I softened my tone, here came the lecture.<br>
“You failed to follow my orders to fill these barrels with usable edibles. You could not even fulfill a part of my order by filling one.” I paused and looked all three over closely. “Had you worked together, you could have filled one of these up with berries, there's enough scattered and ruined in all three. Perhaps you could even have organized fast enough for something for a second barrel too.”<br>
I continued, stepping up to pace behind them.<br>
“You are a crew. Crews work together! They don't compete or rush off to do their own thing, we are weaker divided. You consolidate and cooperate!” I let the words sink in.<br>
“Now go get yourselves cleaned up and take a day off.”</p>
</div>
<div class="cadetQE hidden"><p><strong>Cadet Quest - Island Exploration</strong></p>
<p>“I am assigning you to explore the around the base of the peak of the third and largest of the ‘Three sons’. You will be doing so with a small company of sailors that will be under your combined command.” <br>
The Cadets stood silently, but they excitement was palpable. This would be a rare chance for them to have some autonomy and be away from the ship as well as give orders to crew.<br>
“Mind you, this will only be a brief exploratory mission. You have a day as we leave tomorrow past midday, I expect you back by then.” I told them firmly. <br>
“Yes Captain!” They all responded in chorus. They could be so diligent when given the equivalent of a Cavy on a stick.<br>
The 3 sailors and Low-Officer I put under their command were all experienced and capable. If anything happened they would be able to bring the Cadets back. <br>
“Off you go then, I expect a report tomorrow evening after we depart.” <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="cadetQER hidden"><p><strong>Cadet Quest - Island Exploration</strong></p>
<p>The cadet expedition team return. They seem to be in one piece, though it’s not all smiles and good humor and they appear to be a bit ruffled up from roughing it in the woods and steep cliffs for a day. <br>
The cadets deliver their initial report. <br>
“The place is largely uninhabited. There are however traces of passage that we believe can indicate that this place is sometimes visited by Islanders.” Cadet Glint spoke first at my bidding. She was usually the most comprehensive. <br>
“I SWEAR I saw some little folk scurrying about. Valnos saw them too!” Ziggy could not contain herself any longer. “Right Valnos?” <br>
“I saw something watching us and at another point caught something going through our packs while we camped. But it was dark, they were dark and could have been inquisitive wildlife. Whatever I saw was smaller than me.” Valnos reported hesitantly. <br>
“One threw a very small spear at me!” Ziggy held up a small pointy twig. <br>
I was not quite sure how to take their report. Despite what Ziggy saw, overall it seemed the island was not generally habited. <br>
I asked the Low-Officer for her report and while she looked like she wanted nothing else by drop by the groomery and then her bunk, she reported diligently. <br>
“The Cadets are a little scatterbrained and unorganized, there’s little in terms of hierarchy among them so orders were at times... conflicting. We spent most of the time fruitlessly searching for the tiny phantoms two of them claimed seeing. If what they saw is true, it was worthy of investigation I suppose, but we never saw or found anything but Cadet Ziggy’s pointy stick. They performed as expected from a junior Officer-Cadet.” <br>
I thanked her and sent her on her way. <br>
The Cadets awaited my verdict. <br>
“It sounds to me like you spent most of the time searching for these now unconfirmed small wildlife.” I crossed my arms. “What am I to do about a report like this? You may or may not have seen something, you have a small stick as proof.”<br>
“We did search, Captain. We just didn’t find them!” Ziggy complained. <br>
“I don’t want incomplete reports like this. Whether you saw something or not, you should have confirmed what you were able to confirm. There were 7 of you in total, that should have been enough for a decent wide sweep through the island with time to spare, enough to find any potential hidden settlements or not. Instead you ran from bush to bush looking for shadows.” <br>
I paced back and forth in front of them. <br>
“Did it occur to you that I gave you command over some of the ships most experienced sailors? Did it occur to you to ask them for advice? I expect better and more methodical thinking next time.”</p>

<p>The Raptorians have been sitting quietly down in the depths of the holds for most of the journey. Now they request permission to go ashore and stretch their limbs properly.

<div class="Evoktext hidden">
<p>The Raptorians have been sitting quietly down in the depths of the holds for most of the journey. There is not terribly much heavy labor to go around for all of them. So when not goaded into loosing at cards they are slumbering, training (as far as space allows) or being fussed over by the squires.  The Pack-Master, who's steps can be heard coming from across the ship due to the creak of wood came to my cabin to deliver a request personally. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Pack is bored, they dare nip and growl often.&rdquo; He rumbled.</p>

<p>I had to cock my head at him and frown before he was prompted to continue. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Few who was permitted to landing party smell of dirt and grass.&rdquo; The Pack-Master offered. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you requesting Shore-leave for your Raptorians?&rdquo; I asked firmly, to get to the point. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Squires bade me ask.&rdquo; The Pack-Master huffed a heavy snort of air. </p>

<p>I suppressed a rueful grin. Pack-Master Evok did not like admitting to asking for favors for his pack. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you expect trouble if I say no?&rdquo; I asked. </p>

<p>The Pack-Master slowly shook his head. &ldquo;No, I control pack. Pack knows duty and I remind firmly, often and well.&rdquo; </p>

<p>My landing party has deemed the island as 'safe' from possible hostiles aside from wildlife, not that there's much that could threaten a Raptorian. They are also already winding down their operation and preparing to leave, so whatever investigation they had must nearly concluded. We could be raising anchor and leaving sooner instead.</p>

<p>Well ashore most scatter, running headlong into the woods with weeks of pent up energy while some remain and rowdily wrestle and growl at each-other on the beach. </p>

 <div class="Tungtext hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>"There's nothing here Captain, we looked everywhere." Tung Reported, his back stiff and his fur tousled with occasional thorns and clinging vegetation.</p>

<p>"Well we knew that coming in." I frown at him, but Tung is one of the few in the crew who do not balk at my gaze. "They left no clues at all of where they might have headed?"</p>

<p>"Nothing on the isle. Seems they came in quick, grabbed themselves supplies of fresh-water, a little wood and harvested whatever edible within easy reach. Must have been raining heavily at the time, hence the constructed cover. I say they were here for only a few days tops. Not the whole fleet either, or the place would have been disturbed more, 2 ships perhaps."</p>

<p>I sat back and crossed my arms in thought. While Tung might have gleaned that much of his actions, it did not help us much.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised they need to resupply so soon and with such haste. They should have enough food-stores to last the fleet for many more months yet. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Ah.. yes. We found some giant snakes, nearly lost a troop or two. Very hungry and very aggressive. Also signs that some of the fleet foragers were not as lucky." Tung huffed.</p>

<p>"Signs?" I quirked my brow.</p>

<p>"Better not ask." Tung warned. "Either way, no way to be sure which was the culprit, so we caught some of the fatter ones."</p>

<p>"I'm sure Chef Zat and the Soft-Spoken will be pleased." I dismissed Tung and consulted my charts. The clues were scant, we did not uncover much of use except receiving a boost to our supplies. I'm sure the crew will appreciate the fresh stuff to non-perishables. </p>
 </div>
<div class="Arntext hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>

<p>Our clues here were scant, but it seems clear someone was not planning on resupplying any time soon again and made a big operation out of stocking up quick from the islands. Judging by how cleaned up and little was left around, I suspect that although it was done under efficient haste rather then under any duress. It is likely the fleet used their supplies to move deeper into Thousand Island without having to have to worry for stops. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, while the fleet was here and we found out much of what they were doing, Arns effort uncover little of worth as to where they were going. Its unlikely they headed for any other resupply points at least.</p>

<p> "If anything, while this knot of islands lay a bit further then we'd like on the outskirts of the Thousand Isles. It would still make a suitable Isle for a naval base." Arn spoke with an encouraged tone. </p>

<p>"Really? I thought it seemed alltogether too shallow all around for any large scale operations. I'm sure the Admiralty are not prepared to dredge half an island, cheaper to look elsewhere." </p>

<p> <span class="title"></span> Arn shook his head and pointed at a sketch of the island made by one of the scouts. "Third island, the heavily forested one, along the north side its mostly deep and clear. The only initial challenge are the steep cliffs, but they could be quarried down, cleared and used as building materials, so could the woods. </p>

<p> I nodded my head in understanding and made a note of swinging by the north side on the way out to look at it from the sea. Although Arn had not found much of use in terms of the fleet, this was at least useful to someone back home. </p>
</div>
<div class="Garschtext hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>The time of our stay on these islands are drawing to a close and the last of the deployed Awes are returning to the ship in an organized knot.</p>

<p>Officer Garsch soon presents himself, carrying a few documents.</p>

<p>"You had time and a place to write out there?" I smile faintly. It seems he was ready for a thorough debriefing already.</p>

<p>"We tore some of the flimsier shacks down and rebuilt a few of the sturdier ones and reinforced them to be more comfortable base. They are quite livable in, should we need return." He pointed toward the beach and the knot of few faint shacks visible among the treeline.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised you had time for that." I commented. "Seems like something Officer Tick would do."</p>

<p>He must have noticed me squinting at the beach and helpfully added. "The leftmost one. I had some time to spare while awaiting reports. I did not feel galavanting around the island needed my personal supervision, there was not threat here except some hungry wild-life which were easily steered clear off."</p>

<p>He had a lot of documents to go through so we reconvened for a debriefing at the meeting room adjacent my chambers. They was a scribbled map, detailed reports and a summary of it all. For the sake of expediency, the summary was enough for now.</p>

<p>The camp had indeed been used for gathering supplies. There were signs of etched markings that seemed to be counting of some sort, though Officer Garsch cannot explain why they had not used parchment instead. Perhaps it was raining heavily.</p>

<p>Except for a few trails to waterholes, there are no other signs of presence on the island anywhere. It's an isolated island and likely too far from other groups of isles to be settled by Islanders. Despite its valuable supply of fresh water.</p>

<p>Officer Garsch has added that the potential for the 'Three-sons' Isles as a Admiralty naval base are high, resources and space for a base are abundant. IF the barrier of the shallow shores around the islands can be overcome. I am sure someone at home in the Admiralty will find that report useful.</p>
</div>

<p> Either way, our time at these Isles have come to an end, its time to move on. The last of the crews are boarding as we speak. </p>
<div class="notVisited hidden">
<p>We might have to head for Navpoint 3 where we might find another scout or perhaps some natives for more information. I'd rather we not sail blindly west with no clear destination in mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="Visited hidden">
 We just need to keep heading deeper into the Thousand Isles.<div class="gpirates hidden">The island with pirates we heard about that seems to be one option.<div class="confirmtext hidden"> Luckily we have information from our visit with the Islanders to guide us to alternative safer routes.</p>

<div class="Ticktext hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>I find Ticks report on my desk. I cant help but shake my head ruefully, that Officer was not one for socializing.  </br>
I could have interpret his unwillingness to deliver the report in person as a slight had his performance not been so exceptional.</p>

<p>The marks and scratchings in the wood turned out to contain hidden Admiralty code. The report has them all written down and deciphered.</p>

<p> The code is vague, but refer to positional numbering used in latitudes on standard Admiralty charts. This gives us a pretty clear clue where they were headed next. It is unclear why their destination was so hidden, perhaps they truly have pursuers they're cautious about.</p>

<p>Ticks investigation of the rest of the island was scant at best and much of it, particularly the other two sub-isles, are left unknown and mostly unexplored.</p>
</div>
<div class="Mirrtext hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Mirr approaches casually and delivers her full report on her findings on the beach while casually puffing her tobacco, after a disapproving glance she smoothly stows it.</p>

<p>"Seems they left some clues behind after all, what looked like counting scratches turned out to be code that we could decipher. Credit is where credit is due though, Tick did most of the figuring of that out." She crooned with a smile.</p>

<p>“I'll make a note of it, regardless, good work. You got results and thats what counts. Though I'm not sure how you persuaded him to cooperate outside his core assignments.”</p>

<p>Mirr chuckled at that with a coy smile. </p>

<p>“Oh, Captain. Any Awe is pliable with the right encouragements! Tick is agreeable enough once you know how to navigate his tangles.”</p>

<p>The scratchings in the wood turned out to contain Admiralty code hidden in what appeared to be random marks. </p>

<p> The code is vague, but seems to refer to positional numbering used in latitudes on standard Admiralty charts. This gives us a pretty clear clue where they were headed next. It is unclear why their destination was so enigmatically hidden, perhaps they truly have pursuers they're cautious about.</p>
</div>

<p>Its clear the Fleet stocked up well before heading in deeper into Thousand islands in a hurry. The coded clues appear to point to one of the Fleets preset rendezvous-points deeper in Thousand islands.</p>

<p>Mirrs investigation of the rest of the island was not detailed and much of it, particularly the other two sub-isles, are left unknown.</p>

<div class="notVisited hidden">
<p>We can still backtrack slightly and head towards Navpoint 3 to investigate the possibility of another scout or natives with further information or head on deeper into Thousand Islands to the next rendezvous point we found clues about, marked as Navpoint 4. It is unlikely we will return this way however if we sail on.</p>
</div>
<div class="Visited hidden">
<p> We just need to keep heading deeper into the Thousand Isles to the next rendezvous point, an island to the west, i've now marked as Navpoint 4.<div class="confirmtext hidden"> This seems to match and confirm the information we recieved from the Islanders, We are on the right path.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="gpirates hidden">
<p>Though a riskier choice, there is also the island with pirates we heard about as another possibility.</p>
