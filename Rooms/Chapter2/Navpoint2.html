<p>We sail by many smaller yet forested islands. We are still at the edges of Thousand islands but already I'm starting to understand where this sea got its name. </p>

<p>They are craggy islands with the kind of tough vegetation that can survive being literally submerged by the harsh storms that can rage past these places. I'm none too impressed by the potential hospitality for anyone wishing to live out here, least of all build some kind of port. </p>

<p>As we approach our destination however, the island trio of 'Three sons' come into view well in the distance. Cliffs jut up high on the three islands and lush and diverse plant-life cling to these peaks, making them look like three thick green finger-digits. The three islands are in a sense one big island, they're clearly connected and at low-tide it would be possible to easily cross between them on foot. But right now the high-tides separate the three.</p>

<p>Its no doubt still a wet and windy place most times of the year, but life finds a way to cling to whatever stable place it can find.</p>

<p>It does not take long while circling the islands to find the beach that had seen recent use.</p>

<p>A bay with deep shallow let us sail in and anchor right close to he bay of the second most largest of the island trio. </p>

<p>Scouts report that the largest trail lead to an inland pool. Its nearly been drained of usable fresh water. Other trails likewise lead to smaller wells and one to a small natural clearing.</p>

<p>There are some signs of landing and passage on the closest smaller island too, but none to the extent of this island, its mostly been foraged for food.</p>

<div class="raptorians hidden"><p><strong>  Raptorians want ashore</strong></p>

<div class="noEvoktext hidden">
<p>The Raptorians have been sitting quietly down in the depths of the holds for most of the journey. Now they request permission to go ashore and stretch their limbs properly. Some have expressed the desire to be allowed a day to roam around and get proper exercise and loose their pent-up energy and tension. </p>
<p>My landing party has deemed the island as 'safe' from possible hostiles aside from wildlife. Not that there's much that could threaten a Raptorian. </p>
</div>

<div class="Evoktext hidden">
<p>The Raptorians have been sitting quietly down in the depths of the holds for most of the journey. There is not terribly much heavy labor to go around for all of them. So when not goaded into loosing at cards they are slumbering, training (as far as space allows) or being fussed over by the squires.  The Pack-Master, who's steps can be heard coming from across the ship due to the creak of wood came to my cabin to deliver a request personally. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Pack is bored, they dare nip and growl often.&rdquo; He rumbled.</p>

<p>I had to cock my head at him and frown before he was prompted to continue. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Few who was permitted to landing party smell of dirt and grass.&rdquo; The Pack-Master offered. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you requesting Shore-leave for your Raptorians?&rdquo; I asked firmly, to get to the point. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Squires bade me ask.&rdquo; The Pack-Master huffed a heavy snort of air. </p>

<p>I suppressed a rueful grin. Pack-Master Evok did not like admitting to do favors for his pack. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you expect trouble if I say no?&rdquo; I asked. </p>

<p>The Pack-Master slowly shook his head. &ldquo;No, I control pack. Pack knows duty and I remind firmly, often and well.&rdquo; </p>

<p>My landing party has deemed the island as 'safe' from possible hostiles aside from wildlife, not that there's much that could threaten a Raptorian. They are also already winding down their operation and preparing to leave, so whatever investigation they had must nearly concluded. We could be raising anchor and leaving sooner instead.</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="raptorians2 hidden"><p><strong>Refuse request </strong></p>
<p> They've managed this far without much trouble, now is not the time for playing around on the beach. The Raptorians will have to contend with their daily on-deck excercises a while further. I'd rather not risk having trouble to herd them all back onto the ship. </p>
</div>

<div class="raptorians3 hidden"><p><strong>Let them go ashore </strong></p>
<p>As it seems the fleet let most their crews up to stretch their legs, so I think its wise to do so for my own. </p>

<p>The Raptorians do not even wait to mount any boats, as a troop, they jump overboard one by one and swim the short stretch from the ship to the island. </p>

<p>Well on the shore they noisily dash around with pent up energies, tackle and growl like a rowdy bunch. </p>

<p>The crew who are ashore to refill our water supply wisely keep well out of their way. </p>
</div>


<div class="raptorians4 hidden"><p><strong>Let them roam for a day</strong></p>
<p>I figure its wise to keep the Raptorians happy. I agree to their request to let them roam the island.</p>

<p>They do not even wait for boats to carry them ashore, as a troop they jump overboard one by one and swim the short stretch to the beach. </p>

<p>Well ashore most scatter, running headlong into the woods with weeks of pent up energy while some remain and rowdily wrestle and growl at each-other on the beach. </p>

<p>The crew who are ashore to refill our water supply wisely keep well out of their way. </p>
</div>

<div class="missing hidden"><p><strong>A Raptorian has gone missing.</strong></p>
<p>I should almost have foreseen this happening. But as night falls and its time gather everyone, one Raptorian is reported as missing by the attending squires. </p>

<p>After a quick check and headcount of the crew, it was clear he had not been eaten by a crew-mate (not even Keeper could digest one of them that fast), but gone missing somewhere on the islands.</p>

<div class="noEvoktext hidden">
<p>The Pack volunteers to search with his Raptorians and so do the Scouts, but the scouts say they cant effectively search at the same time as the Raptorians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the pack find its stray, Captain. Pack will be swift!&rdquo; He growls low in agitation. </p>

<p>The Scout-Master has his own ideas.  &ldquo;They no doubt are quite capable of quickly turning the isles upside down in their search. But if you'd rather my troop do a sweep more subtly, just give us the word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They combed the island and found nothing, after expanding the search to the neighboring islands they came upon a particularly fat snake digesting a gargantuan meal.</p>

<p>All signs point to this meal being our missing Raptorian. Rescue however, had come too late. </p>

<p>I should have figured the Raptorians would be foolish and not stick to this one island. Next time i'll make sure they're under more supervision lest they explore the digestive tract of further fauna.</p>

<p>I'll give the Raptorians a chance to fix their mess. I figure they should know best how to find one of their own. </p>

<p>The Packmaster and his Raptorians disappear into the darkening woods of the island once more. </p>

<p>Hours pass and its well into the night as their hulking figures once again reemerge onto the beach, carrying with them their wounded comrade. </p>

<p>This missing Raptorians had tried to scale the cliffs of the larger island and taken a fall into a crevasse. Apparently a large opportunistic serpent of some sort was trying to make a dinner out of him and had to be fought off.</p>

<p>They've injured their leg but the Squires assure me its treatable. </p>

<p>Mirr approaches casually and delivers her full report on her findings on the beach while casually puffing her tobacco, after a disapproving glance she smoothly stows it.</p>

<p>"Seems they left some clues behind after all, what looked like counting scratches turned out to be code that we could decipher. Credit is where credit is due though, Tick did most of the figuring of that out." She crooned with a smile.</p>

<p>“I'll make a note of it, regardless, good work. You got results and thats what counts. Though I'm not sure how you persuaded him to cooperate outside his core assignments.”</p>

<p>Mirr chuckled at that with a coy smile. </p>

<p>“Oh, Captain. Any Awe is pliable with the right encouragements! Tick is agreeable enough once you know how to navigate his tangles.”</p>

<p>The scratchings in the wood turned out to contain Admiralty code hidden in what appeared to be random marks. </p>

<p> The code is vague, but seems to refer to positional numbering used in latitudes on standard Admiralty charts. This gives us a pretty clear clue where they were headed next. It is unclear why their destination was so enigmatically hidden, perhaps they truly have pursuers they're cautious about.</p>
</div>

<p>Its clear the Fleet stocked up well before heading in deeper into Thousand islands in a hurry. The coded clues appear to point to one of the Fleets preset rendezvous-points deeper in Thousand islands.</p>

<p>We can still backtrack slightly and head towards Navpoint 3 to investigate the possibility of another scout or natives with further information or head on deeper into Thousand Islands to the next rendezvous point marked as Navpoint 4. </p>
