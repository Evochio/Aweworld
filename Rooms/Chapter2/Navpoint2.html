<p>We sail by many smaller yet forested islands. We are still at the edges of Thousand islands but already I'm starting to understand where this sea got its name. </p>

<p>They are craggy islands with the kind of tough vegetation that can survive being literally submerged by the harsh storms that can rage past these places. I'm none too impressed by the potential hospitality for anyone wishing to live out here, least of all build some kind of port. </p>

<p>As we approach our destination however, the island trio of 'Three sons' come into view well in the distance. Cliffs jut up high on the three islands and lush and diverse plant-life cling to these peaks, making them look like three thick green finger-digits. The three islands are in a sense one big island, they're clearly connected and at low-tide it would be possible to easily cross between them on foot. But right now the high-tides separate the three.</p>

<p>Its no doubt still a wet and windy place most times of the year, but life finds a way to cling to whatever stable place it can find.</p>

<p>It does not take long while circling the islands to find the beach that had seen recent use.</p>

<p>A bay with deep shallow let us sail in and anchor right close to he bay of the second most largest of the island trio. </p>

<p>Signs of the fleet having been here is everywhere. Abandoned make-shift shelters has been built amongst the woods and sections of trees have been cleared away in places and harvested for their wood judging by the remains of wood-chips and pulp. </p>

<p>Cut out trails of plenty of passage lead further into the island too, it looks almost as if the whole fleet had been trampling around on this beach. </p>

<p>Scouts report that the largest trail lead to an inland pool. Its nearly been drained of usable fresh water. Other trails likewise lead to smaller wells and one to a small natural clearing.</p>

<p>There are some signs of landing and passage on the closest smaller island too, but none to the extent of this island, its mostly been foraged for food.</p>

<p>The large island seems mostly untouched, but it also has less choosable landing spots and seem to consist mostly of slick cliffs and difficult terrain.</p>

<p> A cursory glance through the hastily erected but surprisingly firmly built shacks do not reveal much.</p>

<p> Little appear to have been left that couldn't be carried along. But perhaps someone with astute eyes and time can puzzle something together or find something. </p>

<p> The main objective here is to figure out clues about the whereabout of the fleet and what they may have left behind. </p> 

<p> Our secondary objective of finding an island suitable as a potential forward naval base for the Admiralty I deem of low priority. Like the majority of islands around Thousand Isles, the waters are very shallow all around these islands, making close approach by ship a difficult affair. </p>

<p>The shacks appear to have been mostly used to keep objects rather then people dry from rain. There are signs and remains that reveal they have constructed severals barrels and containers and stocked up very well on water.</p>

<p>One of the shacks were slightly better built then the others and appear to have housed someone in charge. Scratchings in the wood imply a lot of counting having been done. </p>

<p> Good investigation </p>

<p>The shacks appear to have been mostly used to keep objects rather then people dry from rain. There are signs and remains that reveal they have constructed severals barrels and containers and stocked up very well on water.</p>

<p>One of the shacks were slightly better built then the others and appear to have housed someone in charge. Scratchings in the wood imply not only a lot of counting having been done, but also Admiralty code in what at first glance appeared to be random marks. </p>

<p> The code is vague, but seems to refer to positional numbering used in latitudes on standard Admiralty charts. This gives us a pretty clear clue where they were headed next. </p>

<p>Further investigation of the island show less sign of passage then expected. Whoever was here was not here long and focused on their tasks.</p>

<p>It seems clear someone was not planning on resupplying any time soon again and made a big operation out of stocking up quick from the islands. Judging by how cleaned up and little was left around, I suspect that although it was done under efficient haste rather then under any duress. It is likely the fleet used their supplies to move deeper into Thousand Island without having to have to worry for stops. </p>

Perhaps he sees the deployment and assignment as a chance to practise, or perhaps that's the only way to deploy that martial-minded Awe knows.</p>

<p>The Scouts might have performed a cursory check of the islands, but Tungs Awes make sure no stone is left unturned as they soon charge across the seemingly empty forests in search pattern formations.</p>

<p>The abandoned structures become a temporary base of operation, getting to house Tungs Awes and whatever goods the uncovered from the isles. So far, only some wild game. </p>

Most of them are armed lightly as Officer Garsch puts trust in the scout reports. In fact I think I see Scout-Master Krel at the beach himself, invited to take part in the planning, wings at rest under the protective black cloak which is units signature uniform.</p>

<p>They soon disperse over the islands, though some remain to poke around and reinforce shacks left from the islands previous Awe visitors.  I look forward to his report once he is done, it is likely to be as thorough as his deployment.</p>

<div class="raptorians hidden"><p><strong>  Raptorians want ashore</strong></p>

<div class="noEvoktext hidden">
<p>The Raptorians have been sitting quietly down in the depths of the holds for most of the journey. Now they request permission to go ashore and stretch their limbs properly. Some have expressed the desire to be allowed a day to roam around and get proper exercise and loose their pent-up energy and tension. </p>
<p>My landing party has deemed the island as 'safe' from possible hostiles aside from wildlife. Not that there's much that could threaten a Raptorian. </p>
</div>

<div class="Evoktext hidden">
<p>The Raptorians have been sitting quietly down in the depths of the holds for most of the journey. There is not terribly much heavy labor to go around for all of them. So when not goaded into loosing at cards they are slumbering, training (as far as space allows) or being fussed over by the squires.  The Pack-Master, who's steps can be heard coming from across the ship due to the creak of wood came to my cabin to deliver a request personally. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Pack is bored, they dare nip and growl often.&rdquo; He rumbled.</p>

<p>I had to cock my head at him and frown before he was prompted to continue. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Few who was permitted to landing party smell of dirt and grass.&rdquo; The Pack-Master offered. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you requesting Shore-leave for your Raptorians?&rdquo; I asked firmly, to get to the point. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Squires bade me ask.&rdquo; The Pack-Master huffed a heavy snort of air. </p>

<p>I suppressed a rueful grin. Pack-Master Evok did not like admitting to asking for favors for his pack. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you expect trouble if I say no?&rdquo; I asked. </p>

<p>The Pack-Master slowly shook his head. &ldquo;No, I control pack. Pack knows duty and I remind firmly, often and well.&rdquo; </p>

<p>My landing party has deemed the island as 'safe' from possible hostiles aside from wildlife, not that there's much that could threaten a Raptorian. They are also already winding down their operation and preparing to leave, so whatever investigation they had must nearly concluded. We could be raising anchor and leaving sooner instead.</p>
</div>

</div>


<div class="raptorians2 hidden"><p><strong>Refuse request </strong></p>
<p> They've managed this far without much trouble, now is not the time for playing around on the beach. The Raptorians will have to contend with their daily on-deck excercises a while further. I'd rather not risk having trouble to herd them all back onto the ship. </p>
</div>

<div class="raptorians3 hidden"><p><strong>Let them go ashore </strong></p>
<p>As it seems the fleet let most their crews up to stretch their legs, so I think its wise to do so for my own. </p>

<p>The Raptorians do not even wait to mount any boats, as a troop, they jump overboard one by one and swim the short stretch from the ship to the island. </p>

<p>Well on the shore they noisily dash around with pent up energies, tackle and growl like a rowdy bunch. </p>

<p>The crew who are ashore to refill our water supply wisely keep well out of their way. </p>
</div>


<div class="raptorians4 hidden"><p><strong>Let them roam for a day</strong></p>
<p>I figure its wise to keep the Raptorians happy. I agree to their request to let them roam the island.</p>

<p>They do not even wait for boats to carry them ashore, as a troop they jump overboard one by one and swim the short stretch to the beach. </p>

<p>Well ashore most scatter, running headlong into the woods with weeks of pent up energy while some remain and rowdily wrestle and growl at each-other on the beach. </p>

<p>The crew who are ashore to refill our water supply wisely keep well out of their way. </p>
</div>

<div class="missing hidden"><p><strong>A Raptorian has gone missing.</strong></p>
<p>I should almost have foreseen this happening. But as night falls and its time gather everyone, one Raptorian is reported as missing by the attending squires. </p>

<p>After a quick check and headcount of the crew, it was clear he had not been eaten by a crew-mate (not even Keeper could digest one of them that fast), but gone missing somewhere on the islands.</p>

<div class="noEvoktext hidden">
<p>The Pack volunteers to search with his Raptorians and so do the Scouts, but the scouts say they cant effectively search at the same time as the Raptorians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They no doubt are quite capable of quickly turning the isles upside down in their search. But if you'd rather my troop do a sweep more subtly, just give us the word.&rdquo; Said the Scout-Master </p>
</div>
<div class="Evoktext hidden">
<p>The Packmaster volunteer to search with his Raptorians and so do the Scouts, but the scouts say they cant effectively search at the same time as the Raptorians.</p>

<p>Pack-Master Evok is looking most glum. He knows he's ultimately responsible for his Pack and this incident reflects poorly on his leadership as Pack-Master. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the pack find its stray, Captain. Pack will be swift!&rdquo; He growls low in agitation. </p>

<p>The Scout-Master has his own ideas.  &ldquo;They no doubt are quite capable of quickly turning the isles upside down in their search. But if you'd rather my troop do a sweep more subtly, just give us the word.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="missingScout hidden"><p><strong>Scouts</strong></p>
<p>I don't want to risk Raptorians getting into further messes and decide to let my nimble scouts get the assignment. </p>

<p>The scouts fan out and disappear like shadows into the gloom. Its not until well in the morning that they return with their report. </p>

<p>They combed the island and found nothing, after expanding the search to the neighboring islands they came upon a particularly fat snake digesting a gargantuan meal.</p>

<p>All signs point to this meal being our missing Raptorian. Rescue however, had come too late. </p>

<p>I should have figured the Raptorians would be foolish and not stick to this one island. Next time i'll make sure they're under more supervision lest they explore the digestive tract of further fauna.</p>

</div>

<div class="missingRaptorian hidden"><p><strong>Packmaster</strong></p>
<p>I'll give the Raptorians a chance to fix their mess. I figure they should know best how to find one of their own. </p>

<p>The Packmaster and his Raptorians disappear into the darkening woods of the island once more. </p>

<p>Hours pass and its well into the night as their hulking figures once again reemerge onto the beach, carrying with them their wounded comrade. </p>

<p>This missing Raptorians had tried to scale the cliffs of the larger island and taken a fall into a crevasse. Apparently a large opportunistic serpent of some sort was trying to make a dinner out of him and had to be fought off.</p>

<p>They've injured their leg but the Squires assure me its treatable. </p>

<p>I should have figured the Raptorians would be foolish and not stick to this one island. Next time i'll make sure they're under more supervision. </p>

<div class="destination hidden"><p><strong>Destination</strong></p>
<div class="poorInvestigation hidden">
 
 <div class="Tungtext hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>"There's nothing here Captain, we looked everywhere." Tung Reported, his back stiff and his fur tousled with occasional thorns and clinging vegetation.</p>

<p>"Well we knew that coming in." I frown at him, but Tung is one of the few in the crew who do not balk at my gaze. "They left no clues at all of where they might have headed?"</p>

<p>"Nothing on the isle. Seems they came in quick, grabbed themselves supplies of fresh-water, a little wood and harvested whatever edible within easy reach. Must have been raining heavily at the time, hence the constructed cover. I say they were here for only a few days tops. Not the whole fleet either, or the place would have been disturbed more, 2 ships perhaps."</p>

<p>I sat back and crossed my arms in thought. While Tung might have gleaned that much of his actions, it did not help us much.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised they need to resupply so soon and with such haste. They should have enough food-stores to last the fleet for many more months yet. Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Ah.. yes. We found some giant snakes, nearly lost a troop or two. Very hungry and very aggressive. Also signs that some of the fleet foragers were not as lucky." Tung huffed.</p>

<p>"Signs?" I quirked my brow.</p>

<p>"Better not ask." Tung warned. "Either way, no way to be sure which was the culprit, so we caught some of the fatter ones."</p>

<p>"I'm sure Chef Zat and the Soft-Spoken will be pleased." I dismissed Tung and consulted my charts. The clues were scant, we did not uncover much of use except receiving a boost to our supplies. I'm sure the crew will appreciate the fresh stuff to non-perishables. </p>
 </div>
<div class="Arntext hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>

<p>Our clues here were scant, but it seems clear someone was not planning on resupplying any time soon again and made a big operation out of stocking up quick from the islands. Judging by how cleaned up and little was left around, I suspect that although it was done under efficient haste rather then under any duress. It is likely the fleet used their supplies to move deeper into Thousand Island without having to have to worry for stops. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, while the fleet was here and we found out much of what they were doing, Arns effort uncover little of worth as to where they were going. Its unlikely they headed for any other resupply points at least.</p>

<p> "If anything, while this knot of islands lay a bit further then we'd like on the outskirts of the Thousand Isles. It would still make a suitable Isle for a naval base." Arn spoke with an encouraged tone. </p>

<p>"Really? I thought it seemed alltogether too shallow all around for any large scale operations. I'm sure the Admiralty are not prepared to dredge half an island, cheaper to look elsewhere." </p>

<p> <span class="title"></span> Arn shook his head and pointed at a sketch of the island made by one of the scouts. "Third island, the heavily forested one, along the north side its mostly deep and clear. The only initial challenge are the steep cliffs, but they could be quarried down, cleared and used as building materials, so could the woods. </p>

<p> I nodded my head in understanding and made a note of swinging by the north side on the way out to look at it from the sea. Although Arn had not found much of use in terms of the fleet, this was at least useful to someone back home. </p>
</div>
<div class="Garschtext hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>The time of our stay on these islands are drawing to a close and the last of the deployed Awes are returning to the ship in an organized knot.</p>

<p>Officer Garsch soon presents himself, carrying a few documents.</p>

<p>"You had time and a place to write out there?" I smile faintly. It seems he was ready for a thorough debriefing already.</p>

<p>"We tore some of the flimsier shacks down and rebuilt a few of the sturdier ones and reinforced them to be more comfortable base. They are quite livable in, should we need return." He pointed toward the beach and the knot of few faint shacks visible among the treeline.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised you had time for that." I commented. "Seems like something Officer Tick would do."</p>

<p>He must have noticed me squinting at the beach and helpfully added. "The leftmost one. I had some time to spare while awaiting reports. I did not feel galavanting around the island needed my personal supervision, there was not threat here except some hungry wild-life which were easily steered clear off."</p>

<p>He had a lot of documents to go through so we reconvened for a debriefing at the meeting room adjacent my chambers. They was a scribbled map, detailed reports and a summary of it all. For the sake of expediency, the summary was enough for now.</p>

<p>The camp had indeed been used for gathering supplies. There were signs of etched markings that seemed to be counting of some sort, though Officer Garsch cannot explain why they had not used parchment instead. Perhaps it was raining heavily.</p>

<p>Except for a few trails to waterholes, there are no other signs of presence on the island anywhere. It's an isolated island and likely too far from other groups of isles to be settled by Islanders. Despite its valuable supply of fresh water.</p>

<p>Officer Garsch has added that the potential for the 'Three-sons' Isles as a Admiralty naval base are high, resources and space for a base are abundant. IF the barrier of the shallow shores around the islands can be overcome. I am sure someone at home in the Admiralty will find that report useful.</p>
</div>

<p> Either way, our time at these Isles have come to an end, its time to move on. The last of the crews are boarding as we speak. </p>
<div class="notVisited hidden">
<p>We might have to head for Navpoint 3 where we might find another scout or perhaps some natives for more information. I'd rather we not sail blindly west with no clear destination in mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="Visited hidden">
 We just need to keep heading deeper into the Thousand Isles.<div class="gpirates hidden">The island with pirates we heard about that seems to be one option.<div class="confirmtext hidden"> Luckily we have information from our visit with the Islanders to guide us to alternative safer routes.</p>

<div class="goodInvestigation hidden">
<div class="Ticktext hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>I find Ticks report on my desk. I cant help but shake my head ruefully, that Officer was not one for socializing.  </br>
I could have interpret his unwillingness to deliver the report in person as a slight had his performance not been so exceptional.</p>

<p>The marks and scratchings in the wood turned out to contain hidden Admiralty code. The report has them all written down and deciphered.</p>

<p> The code is vague, but refer to positional numbering used in latitudes on standard Admiralty charts. This gives us a pretty clear clue where they were headed next. It is unclear why their destination was so hidden, perhaps they truly have pursuers they're cautious about.</p>

<p>Ticks investigation of the rest of the island was scant at best and much of it, particularly the other two sub-isles, are left unknown and mostly unexplored.</p>
</div>
<div class="Mirrtext hidden"><p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Mirr approaches casually and delivers her full report on her findings on the beach while casually puffing her tobacco, after a disapproving glance she smoothly stows it.</p>

<p>"Seems they left some clues behind after all, what looked like counting scratches turned out to be code that we could decipher. Credit is where credit is due though, Tick did most of the figuring of that out." She crooned with a smile.</p>

<p>“I'll make a note of it, regardless, good work. You got results and thats what counts. Though I'm not sure how you persuaded him to cooperate outside his core assignments.”</p>

<p>Mirr chuckled at that with a coy smile. </p>

<p>“Oh, Captain. Any Awe is pliable with the right encouragements! Tick is agreeable enough once you know how to navigate his tangles.”</p>

<p>The scratchings in the wood turned out to contain Admiralty code hidden in what appeared to be random marks. </p>

<p> The code is vague, but seems to refer to positional numbering used in latitudes on standard Admiralty charts. This gives us a pretty clear clue where they were headed next. It is unclear why their destination was so enigmatically hidden, perhaps they truly have pursuers they're cautious about.</p>
</div>

<p>Its clear the Fleet stocked up well before heading in deeper into Thousand islands in a hurry. The coded clues appear to point to one of the Fleets preset rendezvous-points deeper in Thousand islands.</p>

<p>Mirrs investigation of the rest of the island was not detailed and much of it, particularly the other two sub-isles, are left unknown.</p>

<div class="notVisited hidden">
<p>We can still backtrack slightly and head towards Navpoint 3 to investigate the possibility of another scout or natives with further information or head on deeper into Thousand Islands to the next rendezvous point we found clues about, marked as Navpoint 4. It is unlikely we will return this way however if we sail on.</p>
</div>
<div class="Visited hidden">
<p> We just need to keep heading deeper into the Thousand Isles to the next rendezvous point i've now marked as Navpoint 4.<div class="confirmtext hidden"> This seems to match and confirm the information we recieved from the Islanders, We are on the right path.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="gpirates hidden">
<p>Though a riskier choice, there is also the island with pirates we heard about as another possibility.</p>
