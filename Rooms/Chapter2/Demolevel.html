<div id="story-text">
<p>The seas are rough and overcast. Spray of seawater regularly splash onto the deck and pool around before getting funneled out the sides.</p>
<p>We are spared the worst of the salt-spray upon the higher deck of the helm, but I can see several miserable Awes who's unlucky shift it is to assist with the sails from the bottom of the riggings and lower decks. But such is the life of a sailor. Having salt-frayed and disheveled fur is something of an inevitable mark of a long time sailor, some even display it with pride.</p>
<p>The seas are mostly shallow around the Thousand islands, so the waves do not become quite as monstrous and lethal as they do upon the true open sea. But despite my years of experience I still find myself cringing silently whenever start to crest a particularly large wave that looms like a dark wall of water.</p>
<p>But my ship, 'The Attentive' is handling the waves with stride. It is built for this and I marvel now at the craftsmanship that allows it to so smoothly climb one wave after another. Our bow seems to split the sea before it as we crest another wave smoothly and gently flow down the other side.</p>
<p>The ship isn't doing all of this on its own of course, it would be nothing without the expert handling of our navigator Nyxie at the helm.</p>
<p>I hover by her side, observing our progress, but I've found myself grow fully confident in her ability to skillfully and accurately guide us to our destinations. I can put my mind to other matters as we make our way forward.</p>
<p>Our destination is a lone island away from the other clusters and chains of islands. Its remoteness should guarantee that its uninhabited. Thus its one of the preset rendezvous points of the fleet that we are out here to find.</p>
<p>It is unlikely they will be loitering around this area, we are still at the edges of Thousand Isles proper, but its on the way and might offer clues.</p>
<p>A cry from high up in the masts rouses me from my thoughts. &ldquo;Haaa-hoooo&rdquo; the pitched cry of the lookout calls, land has been sighted. Nyxies navigation has been on-point once more it seems.</p>
<p>She has no time to grin in triumph however as she now shouts orders for the sails to be lowered to turn down our speed. She still has to get us close without crashing us into any inevitably lurking reefs.</p>

<div class="scoutM hidden"><p><strong>Scout-Master</strong></p>
<p>The scout-master approached without needing to be summoned. He knew his duty and heard the cry.</p>
<p>The black-furred male Awe, enveloped in his heavy protective cloak nodded respectfully. Theirs was the task to find out what we were heading into. Not only to spot a safe approach to the island but also to get a preliminary glance at whatever awaited us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Difficult winds today Captain. It will be taxing to fly through.&rdquo; The scouts yellow eyes scanned the horizon toward the growing black shape on the horizon which was the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to get closer before you depart?&rdquo; The Scout-master was a proud one. He would not outright ask for leniency in his duties, but at least he had sense to let me know when something would be difficult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your discretion.&rdquo; The scout-master lowered his head again. He would follow out whatever orders I ordained, his small cadre of Scouts were highly disciplined and loyal, I knew as much and how invaluable they were.</p>
<p>I turn to Nyxie and divert her focus for a minute. But she has been listening and knows he procedure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm not sure captain, with the seas like this I'd sure be more comfortable to have an approach route scouted out for us. I cant quite make out the shallows like this and I'd hate to run into one with these waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They look to me for a decision. Let the scouts fly into the difficult weather now but secure our approach or wait until we're closer and keep relying on Nyxies cunning navigation and sharp eyes of our lookouts.</p>

</div>

<div class="delay hidden"><p><strong>Delay the Scouts</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>We delay the scouts flight to the isles. The seas continue to be rough and the wind even picks up slightly, making us lower further more sails.</p>
<p>I can tell Nyxie is tired from being on edge and at the helm for so long by the time the scouts finally discard their protective cloaks, unfurl their precious wings and climb the masts to take off.</p>
<p>But she relaxes visibly as the winged figures speed ahead and show no signals of any course changes needing to be made.</p>
<p>By the time we are close enough to anchor the scouts return from their trip around the island. They are exhausted, flying takes a lot out of an Awe, even a highly skilled one.</p>
<p>The Scout-master approaches and with some surprisingly animated haste reports his findings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an Awe-ship on the far side of the island Captain! It looks like its been run aground onto the beach inside an inlet. We saw no encampment or signs of life. The Island looks uninhabited too, no visible settlements from the air. Dense foliage all around so hard to fully say if anyone is hiding however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship is intact?&rdquo; I blink at the startling news. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There was visible marks of battle-damage, but it looked mostly intact from our vantage.&rdquo; The Scout-Master replied. Seems we are on the right trail after all, but these news are more then a bit puzzling.</p>

</div>


<div class="send hidden"><p><strong>Send the Scouts</strong></p>
<p>I send the scouts ahead despite the weather and wind. The safety of the ship is paramount and they'll will have to endure a little difficulty now and then.</p>
<p>The Scout-master makes no complaint as his cadre discard their protective cloaks, unfurl their precious wings and climb the masts to take off.</p>
<p>Nyxie relaxes visibly as the departing winged figures make no signals about any needed course changes. It seems my navigator is now allowed to finally relax.</p>
<p>By the time we are close enough to anchor the scouts return from their trip around the island. They are very exhausted, flying takes a lot out of an Awe, even a highly skilled one.</p>
<p>The Scout-master approaches and with hard eyes of concern haste reports his findings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an Awe-ship on the far side of the island Captain. It looks like its been run aground onto the beach inside an inlet. We saw no encampment or signs of life. Island looks uninhabited too, no visible settlements. Dense foliage all around so hard to fully say if anyone is hiding however.</p>
<p>One of my scouts had to land near the ship as we were taking a look, caught a downdraft but got lucky. They were unable to take off again and are waiting on site.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its only now that I indeed realize they are one short, but the startling news take precedent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship is intact?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was visible marks of battle-damage, but it looked mostly intact from our vantage.&rdquo; The Scout-Master replied.</p>
<p>Seems we are on the right trail after all, but these news are more then a bit puzzling.</p>
</div>


<div class="expedition hidden"><p><strong>Expedition</strong></p>
<p>I'm informed we cannot simply sail around the island to the inlet. The only safe approaches are on the north and south side and we are on the southern side. We'd have to sail out and around and then return and with these hard waves and wind and sun low in the sky its best to leave that for tomorrow.</p>
<p>For now I should send a crew ashore to go investigate the site (and recover our scout).</p>
<p>The chosen officer and their team will secure the island and the beach and set up a small camp. We don't have many small boats and we cant get the 'Attentive' that close without risking beaching ourselves as well.</p>
<p>As much as I'd like to go personally, Admiralty doctrine states to send at the most the First-officer for initial excursions like this. The Captain should always to stay with the ship unless its safety absolutely secure.</p>
<p>Below are the Officers on the current rotation to handle the mission.</p>

</div>


<div class="expedition2 hidden"><p><strong>Expedition</strong></p>
<p>The expedition sets out right away, rowing their boats toward shore. The sky is dimming but they should be able to make it to the site before nightfall.</p>
<p>We loiter for a while to ensure they make their landing safely and then start our journey to backtrack out of the shoals that surround us and come back on the far side with the inlet by the light of morning.</p>
<p>Its a mystery to as to why a Awe-ship has been seemingly abandoned here. Admiralty doctrine is very clear on the matter that our ships must never fall into foreign hands, lest they receive a way to construct and copy our strengths and learn of our ships weaknesses. A ship must always be scuttled and destroyed if its about to be lost or has been too severely damaged.</p>
<p>The ship appears to be somewhat well-hidden, but there is only so much you can do to truly hide a whole frigate.</p>
<p>This breach in rules carry with it some unsettling possibilities. Did they not have time to sink it? Were they wary of the smoke of burning it? Has there been betrayal? Tomorrow will hopefully bring answers.</p>

</div>

<div class="expedition3a hidden"><p><strong>The Ship</strong></p>
<p>We arrive on the north side to find our expedition waiting along with our stranded scout.</p>
<p>The expedition team reports finding little but dense and difficult brush and woods upon the island. The scout reports hearing noise and movement during the night but there are no trails or initial signs of inhabitance, a more thorough search could be made but would take needless time and resources. Focus which I'd rather put to investigate the mystery of the stranded ship and why its here.</p>
<p class="tungtext hidden">Tung returns to our ship with his report, there are twigs and brambles in his fur. “No one lives here, but there's been people on the island. Cut down trees and some old dismantled canoes left behind to the west. I don't believe there is but if there's anyone here they are very few and hiding well.” </p>
<p class="ulvtext hidden">Ulv saunters up after having returned to the ship. She appears to have fortified the beach well. “Its hard to tell and might be my imagination, but there are a lot of curious tracks around the inlet and the stranded ship. But we saw no one. The ship is a mess however, poor thing.”</p>
<p class="arntext hidden">Arn looks relieved to be back on the ship, though he doesent look much worse for wear. “There appears to be no trace of any permanent inhabitants on this island. Though there were signs of cut down trees here and there, there are no Awes on the island of that I'm sure, no response to our cries.”</p>

<p>It appears the Awe-ship, a frigate of the same model of ours, is entirely abandoned. There has been nothing of use left behind. Its stripped clean and is little but a empty husk.</p>
<p>The damage the scouts initially reported is extensive. Part of the main mast is missing and the hull carries several punctures on the side that match the kind of damage we sustained in our own battle not long ago.</p>
<p>Its clear the frigate is unfit for open-sea, was slowed considerably and would not have made it back home to port. The expedition have spent much of the night searching the ship for any messages or further clues but found nothing.</p>
<p>Officer Tick is insistently requesting to disembark and investigate the stranded Frigate further. He also reports that despite the ship being thoroughly stripped of supplies he might be able to use the ship itself to gain some useful replacement parts for our own ship.</p>
<p>He knows these ships best, so perhaps he can uncover some clues others might have missed too.</p>
<p>But he'd need a day to perform his scavenging operation.</p>
</div>

<div class="expedition3b hidden"><p><strong>The Ship</strong></p>
<p>We arrive on the north side to find our expedition waiting</p>
<p>The expedition team reports finding little but dense and difficult brush and woods upon the island. They confirm seeing no signs of inhabitance and that the island has little but minor wildlife on it. As long as there's no lost mystery crews running arounds the woods im satisfied. I'd rather investigate the mystery of the stranded ship and why its here.</p>

</div>


<div class="cadets hidden"><p><strong>Busywork for Cadets</strong></p>
<p>The cadets have been growing restless and getting underfoot. Perhaps they need a mission of their own to occupy their time and give them some experience as junior officers. There are a number of things they could be put in charge of.</p>
<p>They could be ordered to assist Ticks operation with the stranded ship, that would be safe but there's a chance they might hinder more then help, but Tick rarely tolerates any nonsense.</p>
<p>Or they could be set to work to find useful supplies on the island. We are not really in any kind of short supply, but it will be useful and arduous experience. The island is small enough that it would be quite a feat for them to get lost.</p>
</div>

<div class="cadetsA hidden"><p><strong>Busywork for Cadets</strong></p>
<p>Tick was not an Awe who bothered hide his disdain. He eyed the three cadets with a look of resigned weariness as I saddled the three of them upon him. He was a notoriously hard Officer to please so it was with some satisfaction I issued my orders and watched the Cadets squirm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're to assist Officer Tick with his work on the Frigate. You shall obey his every whim and order to perfection and unless I receive a glowing review from him of your work by the end of this I might be inclined to find another use of you that will, for as long as that takes. Whether that means new careers tarring the bilge or serving him breakfast. Understood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain!&rdquo; The three cadets spoke in practiced unison.</p>
<p>I waved them off with a paw and the short Awe officer sighed, crossing his arms. He showed no sign of enjoying this, but then again I wouldn't expect as much from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alright. Come along Breakfasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned on his heel and marched off, Cadets falling in step behind him after a moment of hesitation.</p>
</div>

<div class="cadetsB hidden"><p><strong>Busywork for Cadets</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect you to fill all three of these barrels with some manner of fresh or otherwise edible produce that will pass Cooks inspection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain! Of course!&rdquo; Glint saluted stiffly, eager to please and make up for their previous mischief.</p>
<p>Two other two cadets equally stood silently, seeming to share their fellow cadets excitement. This would be a rare chance for them to have some autonomy and be away from the ship.</p>
<p>But I suspected they didn't quite understand yet that it was no field trip they were being sent out upon.</p>
<p>In a way I was setting them up to fail, they only had a day and the island, although dense, was small and seemed to contain mostly brambles and knotty old trees of the non-fruit bearing variety.</p>
<p>But it would be interesting to see what they came up with, even if they ended up shoving each-other into the barrels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a day, then I expect the barrels back right here on deck, full or with a damn good excuse!&rdquo; I added quite some bite to my tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Captain!&rdquo; All three saluted in unison, their fur bristling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get to it then, dismissed!&rdquo; I watched them pause in hesitation, look at the barrels and then at the shore of the island not far from our anchored position. I raised my brow at them and they scrambled in confusion, grabbing a barrel each and rolling them aimlessly in separate directions before erupting in a chatter with each other.</p>
<p>They would have to arrange transport to and fro on their own too of course.</p>
</div>


<div class="raidA hidden"><p><strong>A raid in the night</strong></p>
<p>Something has happened over night at the stranded Frigate. A rushed and confused report woke me to inform me that there has been some form of attack upon Officer Tick and his crew during the night. There are injuries and the officer is missing, likely he's been captured in the confusion. The identity of our attackers are not entirely clear either, but they were apperently Gryphs, half a dozen or so.</p>
<p>The ship is already on high alert and I'm met by my First-Officer as I walk out of my chambers, still clasping my cloak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your orders Captain? The scouts took a quick tour into the air and report seeing no other ships then ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anyone gone after them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain. The Cadets were on site during the attack. They were spotted rushing after the assailants into the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bite down a curse and consider my options briefly.</p>
<p>I can unleash the Raptorians upon the islands and have them scour it. Its a bit of a heavy-handed move, they are not the most delicate tool for anyone hoping for non-violent outcomes, but they are fast.</p>
<p>Or I could deploy the scouts to lead as pathfinders to fine-comb the island with a unit of Awes. A more versatile approach but not quite as fast.</p>
</div>



<div class="conclusionA hidden"><p><strong>A raid in the night</strong></p>
<p>I stand atop the mast in the crows-nest with the look out as he points out the tiny sails racing away from the island to me. Two very small vessels, perhaps not even as big as our landing crafts, are escaping the island toward the west. The boats are small enough to easily maneuver over and past the reefs covering the area there.</p>
<p>Its not long before the report from the response team reach me with the results. The enemy has fled, they failed to catch them. But Officer Tick has been rescued and recovered, with help from none less then the Cadets who apparently were instrumental in seeing him freed.</p>
<p>They are shook up and bruised, but none worse for wear. I'm torn whether to chastise them right away or later for their recklessness. Things could have gone far worse.</p>
<p>I'm told the assailants was a group of Gryph Islanders who had been laying low and hidden on the island all along. They were not of a tribes we have yet to encounter, likely they belong to the numerous fertile 'Isles of sand' to our west. They had materials which they had been scavenging from our ship but its unclear what their intentions were with trying to kidnap Officer Tick.</p>

<div class="conclusionB hidden"><p><strong>A raid in the night</strong></p>
<p>I stand on the deck as the thundering noise of a full compliment of Raptorians crashing themselves through the tree-line and disappearing into the woods of the island slowly fade.</p>
<p>Their eagerness for action and a hunt is comforting, but I cant help but nervously hope they have the restraint to leave people they are supposed to rescue intact in their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Its a time of tense waiting while I organize a second party to make landfall and follow up on the Raptorians word arrives sooner then I had expected.</p>
<p>The captors have been found and dealt with. The missing Officer and cadets are recovered and mostly unharmed, if somewhat bruised. I'm told the cadets were even instrumental in guiding the Raptorians to the right place before they could leave the islands on very small sailing crafts that they had kept hidden and disassembled.</p>
<p>I'm told the assailants was a group of Gryph Islanders who had been laying low and hidden on the island all along. They were not of a tribes we have yet to encounter, likely they belong to the numerous fertile 'Isles of sand' to our west. They had materials which they had been scavenging from our ship but its unclear what their intentions were with trying to kidnap Officer Tick.</p>
<p>Alas none remain to be questioned.</p>
