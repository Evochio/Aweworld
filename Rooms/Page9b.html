<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>I decided to put a stop to it and with Cadet Ziggy in tow, confronted First-Officer Arn and Keeper about it in the holds below. Keeper was drowsy from his big meal but it didn&rsquo;t stop him from trying to be clever with me. Wulfs can be infuriating in how they walk the line between polite formality and veiled snark.</p>

<p>The games are apparently well documented and the stakes signed. Raptorian private CusK had signed his will before willingly honoring his loss.</p>

<p>Arn gave me some speech about how morale will be affected if I go interfering in what my crew does for a pastime. And it is true these issues are above captains matters. But as I aptly explained to the officers, some games or personal debts should not endanger the crews chances to fulfill the mission. They belong to the Admiralty out here, not this Wulfs belly. I demanded he limited the stakes of the game so there would be no further loss of valuable ships resources.</p>

<p>Keeper appeared somewhat abashed, but he could have been putting on a face. One never knows with Wulfs. Arn seemed to only reluctantly nod, one of his big brows twitching in agitation. I had a feeling i was stepping on some toes here.</p>
