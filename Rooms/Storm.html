<h1>Storm</h1>
</div>
<div id="story-text">
<em><p> I dreamt of green hills, fresh breezes, flowers and scents. The memories of home always seem to beckon unexpectedly. Of lonely carefree days, free of responsibility. </p>

<p> Melons face, innocent and eyes alight with wonder. Like so many eager faces, hanging on my every word. Begging for more embellished storybook tales, whining about having to have to learn the numbers and letters. </p>

<p> I left all that behind. Why did i write this down? </p> </em>

<p>Im awoken to the ship rocking unusually. That means on thing, storm on the horizon. It doesent look too big, but it lays straight in our path. We could try to sail around it, but that could still take many extra days. The crew is still fresh and the ship is in top shape so we could also chance going through it.</p>

<p> I consulted with Officer Nyxie, our navigator. </P>
</br>

<p> "Yes Captain. We can cut straight through that weather if we have to. It appears to be more on the border of a squall then a real storm anyhow." Nyxies eyes narrowed as she seemed to stare down the clouds ahead of the ship. </p>

<p> "So your assesment is that its of little danger to us." I calmly confirm. Her thoughts echo my own. </p>

<p> "There is always danger Captain. Even squalls in the west can be considerable trouble. Some light damage should always be expected and be prepared for." </p>


<p>I&#39;ve yet to see what this ship can do. But i have to keep the overall objective in mind.</p>

<div class="through hidden"><p><strong>Going through the storm</strong></p>
<p>I never expected the weather to be this rough! We&#39;re not even past the Sea of fangs yet, i never expected the waves to be this large. Several whirling towers of wind and water have also been spotted not far from the ship. We best hope none of those get in our path!</p>

<p>The ship is holding together well so far, its built for this, most of the crew are holed up below. Only the most skilled and bravest sailors are in the masts, tending the lines and forward sail. But we&#39;re all soaked and miserable on this ship one way or another.</p>

<p>I arrive on deck, cloak flapping in the wind, i have to adjust the straps on my cap briefly so its not stolen by the storm. I have been taking turn with Nyxie and it is soon my turn at the helm again. Perhaps i should take over entirely until we are in the clear, I feel responsible.</p>

<p> Suddenly i hear a faint shout of warning from above over the howling wind. A rope has snapped among the sails, this has made part of the top sail unfurl itself and snap taut in the hard wind. Hard enough to break loose a part of the top mast and send it tumbling down toward deck. Right at the helm </p>

<p> Normally sharp and attentive Nyxie stands unaware, her attention fixed on keeping the ship steady. </p>
</div>

<div class="around hidden"><p><strong>Going around the storm</strong></p>
<p>We got into some choppy water, but managed to stay out of the center of the storm. The clouds look rough in there and im somewhat glad of the decision, even though this course will take us many days to catch up from.</p>

<p>I worry these delays will make it harder to catch our rendezvous before they head for other seas. Furthermore, with good speed, perhaps we could have caught whoever attacked that merchant vessel. I confess i have a taste for pirate i do not want to miss out on.</p>
</div>

<div class="trust hidden"><p><strong>Shout a warning</strong></p>
<p> I shouted. She heard me but not the meaning of my words and gesticulation. </p>

<p>As the piece of the top second mast came tumbling down onto deck, there are casualties, one overboard, fell from the masts and regretfully lost at sea and another, Nyxie herself, hit by falling pieces. She is in tending pouch-care with the ships physician Elda. Im told she will recover and that her injury was not severe.</p>

<p>She was hurt in the line of duty, but i still cant help feel responsible. A short memorial was also held for the private sailor lost in the storm. The mood on the ship is understandably dampened, no one relishes the thought of being swallowed by the cold uncaring sea. </p>

<p>The crew of <em>"Attentive"</em> are to be commended, for whatever other faults no one can question their skill when it the matters. They worked hard and diligently and that accident did not turn into a disaster.</p>

<p>The wind is finally dying down however and we are out of the worst of it. The mast looks repairable, so it should not slow us down too much.</p>
</div>



<div class="takeover hidden"><p><strong>Push her out of the way</strong></p>

<p> I remember rushing toward Nyxie as debris fell, I knew I was being foolish and risking both of us instead, but my feet moved on their own, a shout would never be overheard in this wind. Nyxie staggered at my push, but then it was all dark. 

<p>I thought i had died and had again been&nbsp;reborn. Waking up in the dark and warm pouch of Elda, the ships physician, with little memory of how i got there was&nbsp;quite jarring.</p>

<p>Im told i was hit by a piece of mast that came crashing down. A glancing blow to the head and a fractured shoulder with a helping of bruises. Luckily no one else was injured but it was a close thing.</p>

<p>I was prescribed pouch-rest for three days in our capable Physician and Pouch-Matrons care. She is like a stern dotting parent and refused the option of waiting for me to wake up so i could decide whether to heal on my own or not. In this matter she outranks me. Im sure she also relished the chance to keep a captain about her person for a while.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="images/assets/medicpouch.png" height="40%" width="40%"/> 
<p>Arn was acting-captain during my healing slumber, we had a few days of quiet sailing and I appear to have missed little, or so he reports.</p>

<p>Im still dizzy at the time of writing, a little sore and ravenously hungry. But if there ever was proof of the miracle of pouch-cures, im such a one. Sap your reserves something fierce however.</p>

<p> Nyxie was here expressing her gratitude and displeasure with herself. I've reassured her all is well. If something good came out of this its that the crew seem impressed by my selflesness. </p>
