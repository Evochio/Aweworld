<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>I order us to stay on course. Searching the islands here are fruitless. We cannot send flier into the air this far out to sea because of the winds and wet squalls are too dangerous. Rescue in these currents doubly so. That means he&#39;d have to sail by island after island and expose us to the dangers of running ashore ourselves.</p>

<p>After sailing for a few more hours there are no further traces of wreckage.</p>

<p>The dangers ahead will only grow. But thats why we are here.</p>
