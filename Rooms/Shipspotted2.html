<p>Repairs are ongoing under heavy sheets of rain, but to really fix some of the more serious damage, we need a week or more in a port. I was taking a moments respite from overseeing the work, admiring a recovered projectile shot on my desk, a heavy ball or iron as it turned out, when the alarm came again. I heard it this time and was dressed and marching toward the door when the knock from my cadet came. </p>

<p>Another ship is spotted by the look-out, this one appearing from the east and closing in fast. I was not feeling overly confident in another encounter, especially if they're as fast as that. </p>

<p>But soon the report comes in. 4 Masts and side-sails. Gryph ship. I can almost feel how the tension of the crew, including my own, lifts with some relief. </p>


<br />

<p>Soon it becomes increasingly apparent this could be none-else then House Blueleaf again, who we met previously in what feels like ages ago. It seems they did beat the tide.</p>

<p>As they close in, seeming to give us wide berth, I order a flag hoisted. Not one demanding inspection this time as we have no official authority here, but one for parlay and discussion. </p>

<p>They could ofcourse choose to ignore it, but they are not in as big a rush this time as before I was hoping. </p>

<p>Its not long before they approach and a familiar figure once more comes flying over. </p>

<p>I greet Kveest upon the deck as he's looking around at our damage with some dismay. </p>

<br />

<p>“Hail, Illustrious Captain Avolc, we meet again!”</p>

<p>“Greetings Kveest! Was the trade-run of the Blueleaf successful?” I ventured politely. Ignoring the work and bustle progressing all around. </p>

<p>“Oh! Quite! Our timing fetched us good prices on wares that would not be available for several moon-passages! Business with your nation has always been profitable.” Kveest suddenly perked with a notion. </p>

<div class="hidden" id="helped">

<p>“Oh...! The captain Russel sends his regards. They weathered quite a storm after you parted with them but made it out alright. We assisted them with their sails and got quite a discount with the merchant-league, just as you said!”</p>

<p>Kveest motions toward some of the damage of my ship. </p>
</div>
<div class="hidden" id="noHelped">

<p>“Oh...! That merchant-vessel you asked us to check on. We found them floating in the water, more drifting in the tide then going anywhere.” Kveest looked momentarily troubled. "It was a hard storm that hit them, we recovered who we could. It is an unfortunate business this, their captain was quite distraught with loss." </p>

<p>Kveest motions toward some of the damage of my ship, eager to change the subject. Im grateful for it.</p>
</div>

<p>“Your fine ship is injured. Did you catch those pirates responsible?”</p>

<div class="hidden" id="explosion">

<p>“Hrm, you could say that! Not much left of them but pieces and smoke.”</p>

<p>“So it was you then... we saw the smoke. Wondered what it could have been.” Kveest spoke in admiration. "You gave them vengeance for your injuries!"</p>

</div>
<div class="hidden" id="retreat">

<p>“We were forced to put on speed and outrun them.” I explained. </p>

<p>“So it was them we spotted heading south-east. We thought it an unusually large Wulf-ship.” Kveest regards the damage of the ship. "You look to have made a wise choice to take wing."</p>

</div>
<div class="hidden" id="ram">
<p> "We rammed them hard and fought. But they managed to break off and escape. But atleast we managed to disable their weapons." I spoke proudly, glancing at the crew around me. </p>

<p> "Ah!" Kveest whistled approvingly. "The fabled prowess and courage of Awes proven true once more then! But they escaped your grasp?" </p>

</div>
<div class="hidden" id="board">
<p> "It was a hard battle, we managed to board them, but were unable to capture them. But atleast we managed to disable their weapons." I spoke proudly, glancing at the crew around me. </p>

<p> "Ah!" Kveest whistled approvingly. "The fabled prowess and courage of Awes proven true once more then! But they escaped your grasp?" </p>

</div>

<p>“They had frightful weapons I have not seen or heard of before. Have yo ever seen or heard of devices that boom with noise and send projectiles of heavy iron whistling through the air as if they were mere lightning.” I motioned toward a gaping hole a shot had penetrated through.</p>

<p>Kveest seemed taken aback and startled by the mention of such weapons. </p>

<p>“In mere whisper, rumor or tall tale! Many of such which circulate the seas of late.” He looked around and inspected one of the recovered projectiles I showed to him. “It is another thing to see and touch. By Krakow, this is worrying, most worrying. I must report this to my sire! Who may need to report it to the House assemblies!”</p>
</div>
<div id="tail">
<button class="btn btn-default hidden" id="button-1">A Ceremony</button>
<button class="btn btn-default" id="button-2">Information</button>
<span id="cadetButtons"> </span>
</div>
<div class="information hidden"><p><strong>Information</strong></p>

<p>I decided to press harder. It didnt feel like he was telling me everything. </p>

<p>“Surely there must be knowledge of these devices. Something of such power in the hands of pirates. They did not make them on their own! You Gryphs are traders of both goods, skill and information, you cant have been oblivious of this.”</p>

<p>It seems to stump Kveest briefly. And he merely nods to me in agreement.</p>

<p>“You speak truth Avolc. Such information must exist. I do not either believe we could be blind to such devices and threat. But I am merely the 5<sup>th</sup> son of Mraewk, I have not been educated of such secrets. I am sorry, but I cannot be of help.” He bobbed his head low in apology. </p>

<p>“Then let me speak to Mraewk! I need to know more what we're up against.” I urged. But Kveest just shook his head sadly again. </p>

<p>“Im sorry Captain Avolc. I... cannot guarantee that. I will take your request back to him and report, but we'll likely depart the moment im back aboard. But there are things going on... that I can only guess at! For the past years we have started taking wide-berth around Thousand-islands, wasting sometimes a week. We avoid all ships if we can. When I ask about it I only get the old mantra “..In risk lays ruin” as answer. “ Kveest sounded exasperated. </p>

<p>“We only stopped for you because you were in Awe-waters with the right banners and now because you are familiar. But even then...” He motioned to the distant Trade-vessel, bobbing in the water a distance away. “... my sire takes every precaution.”</p>

<p>I fumed at this, displeased, but did not take my anger out on Kveest. He was low on the hierarchy of leadership I understood. High enough in family-stature to not be an insult when sent as envoy, low enough not to be told anything. Kveest continued in a low tone.</p>

<p>“But... if its information you seek. Perhaps you'll find it there, where we now avoid going. Port of Nowhere.”</p>

<p>He had my full attention now. I perked and looked him in the eyes. </p>

<p>“Where is it?” </p>

<p>“Its nowhere...!” He held up his hands before I could say anything, seeing my fur poof in irritation no doubt. “... because its moving! Its a floating port! They take it from island to island, to be safe from the tides and occasional eruption.” He explained. “It belongs to no nation, I hear it started as a shipwreck and grew from there. It became the last stop before the great sea and the way east to your continents. A free-port with no masters!” Kveest explained, but he looked uncomfortable doing it. </p>

<p>“If it floats around, how do we find it?” I muttered in thought. </p>

<p>“Its Three-moon tide now. Water flows with great strength westward around there now. You'll find it on the west side, in the bay of one of the larger islands. But it cannot be safe there anymore, there must be a reason we avoid it, despite the easy profit for the simplest of wares. ” </p>

<p>I nodded and then moved forward to shake Kveests paw. “Thank you Kveest. You have been to a great service and help.” </p>

<p>The gryph seemed to blush and trilled a coo, smiling charmingly. </p>

<p>“Ah, my pleasure Captain Avolc! I admire your folk, you are hardy and straight-forward. I should return...”</p>

<p>And with that he departed suddenly. Taking wing back to his vessel. True to his word, the Trade-Cruiser was eager to leave, hoisting sails to pick up speed as soon as they saw him on the way back. </p>

<p>We got all the information we would get. But it had been enough to give us a destination and goal. </p>

<p>We'll head for Port Nowhere, uncover its secrets, find our fleet, the nest of the pirates or both!</p>
