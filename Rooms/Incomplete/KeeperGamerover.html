<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>A pair of feet appeared ahead of me, Wulf feet. I strained to look up then and could only see the fur of a domed sagging large gut. He couldnt mean to actually...!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wulf greed knew no bounds, i was hoisted up off my feet and presented to Keepers face.</p>

<p>&quot;Im of two mind about this Captain. On one side i respect you. You are obviously strong and capable. His stretched belly emitted muffled low wet grumble.</p>

<p>On the other... the thought of adding your strengths to mine, legally i might add, is too much to pass up.</p>

<p>&quot;Goodbye Captain. And Welcome to &#39;Me&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>His green maw presented itself. Before i could object or get a chance to kick him in the face i was crammed in head-first. Tongue rippled under my chin, the gullet opened up and with a push from behind i slid into darkness.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>His muscles just contract and squeeze all around me and cram me into that already taut and sagging fat tum, the belly stretches even further to make room for me. His gut is hot and sloshing with the still digesting remnants of his previous large Raptorian meal, but im still forced into the stomach with ease, pushing contents out of the way briefly before they gurgleslosh in around me and surround me in their muck.</p>

<p>The pressure, heat and stale air is overpowering, i splash and buck and cause the stomach to loudly &#39;gwuurrbblee&#39; wetly around me. A sudden deep rumble and the stomach tightens ever closer as Keeper belches loudly and wetly around me. I spit, gag and moan in embarrassed humiliation, for a brief moment bucking and twisting and slushing against the growing constriction of muscles grinding the digestive juices and muck against me. I dont want to perish here, like this, to this person. Smug and coy little &quot;book-Keeper&quot;.&nbsp; I can imagine him laying back in his seat, arms to his sides and his huge noisy and wiggling stomach in his lap shown off for all to see.</p>

<p>Another deep gurgle and im nearly engulfed in muck again, rolled around and churned hard. Im about to make a shout but whatever pause the stomach was in due to my arrival is over. I digest... im digesting... he&#39;s digesting me....! Gluuurrrgggggkble~</p>
