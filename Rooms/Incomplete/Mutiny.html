<h1>Admiral Avolc</h1>
<hr />
<p>They come in the night, sneaking and whispering. Its hard to be prepared for the majority of a crew rising up against you.</p>

<p>Its a sudden crash as the door flies open and they come rushing into the captains quarters, weapons, ropes and nets at the ready.</p>

<p>Im on my feet, drawing my saber from its scabard beside the bed, but im overwhelmed in moments.</p>

<p>I wonder briefly what came of my cadets, they are nowhere in sight in the crowd that overwhelm me at least.</p>

<p>It was a battle they&#39;d claim, after having limped back to port once more with the ship in bad need of repair. A hard battle against superior numbers. The captain fought bravely, but she did not make it. But her sacrifice allowed for the rest of the crew to make a break for it and flee.</p>

<p>They&#39;d falsely praise her memory and make up tales to cover their deed. Maybe the next captain would be better. Maybe this one would understand how they wanted things to be run and not put its nose where it didnt belong.</p>

<p>Otherwise they would draw the lots again, see what lucky sailor got the honor of a grand captains feast.</p>

<p>It was the agile quiet lookout that won Avolc. Drew his lucky lot and did a little wordless jig. Up in the masts the politics and ongoings of the holds below mattered little to him. But he&#39;d certainly not say no to a plump refined officer-awe filling him up.</p>
