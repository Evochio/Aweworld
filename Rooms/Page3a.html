<p> We've departed. It was done without pomp and ceremony as we were in some rush to catch up to schedule. I've been watching the crew in action and have so far been impressed by their speed and efficiency. </p>

<p>We are making good progress; favorable winds are sure to put us ahead of schedule. The ship is fast and the crew knows her well. I expect us to arrive at the Sea of fangs in about 15 days. Our rendeuvouz with the Wulfs are in 25 days. We should just about make it, even with some days of bad winds.</p>

<p>Im pleased to report the crew has showed no further reproach or signs of animosity towards me or the cadets. I was worried Tungs attitude would be a more widespread attitude, but either he was alone with it or it dissolved away along with him. </p>

<p> The cadets are in fact blending in well and have become something of good luck charms for the crew.&nbsp; I have made sure to patrol the ship daily, learn its ins and outs and make myself seen and learn names. Officer Tung has at least served me well as a visible reminder of authority, in a both literal and figurative sense.</p>

<p>My hunger finally returned this morning and I joined the senior crew in the joint mess for the first time. Ship-rations never sat with me well, a fact doubtless shared by all as my urging for someone else to break the rules and replace my plate was received with genuine merriment, even among the Raptorians. The ice seems to have been broken.</p>
