<p><em>Admirals log. Avolc</em></p>

<p><em>Safepouch gulf</em></p>

<p><em>Day 6</em></p>

<p><em>The wind gives and the wind takes. Slow progress over the last 2 days, we are still in the gulf. Nothing but merchants passing us by, heading for Tranquil.</em></p>

<p><em>Uneventful days have at least given me the chance to further socialize and I am starting to grow familiar with some of the crew, my attentive competitive cadets most of all. They have brought me some interesting younglings on this voyage. They are eager to please and impress and have become something of my eyes and ears about the goings on in the crew.</em></p>

<p><em>Cadet Glint seems to come from a religious family, of the three she&rsquo;s the most stoic and mature, but i have seen hints of mischievousness, perhaps even ambition lurking under the surface. She&rsquo;s taken to the ships Soft-spoken and the Awe&rsquo;s who attend her services. Say what you will of the new religion, its here to stay and the following is larger then I expected. Im told half the awes on the ship are followers and regularly attend service.&nbsp; By the end of the journey, perhaps there will be more.</em></p>

<p><em>Cadet Valnos seems a wary sort, I first worried if he had the nerve to serve on a ship or was of any officer material for that matter, how did he ever graduate from the tough demands of the academy. But he hides an inquisitive kind of bravery in him that surprised me. He may seem easily cowed and intimidated but he&rsquo;s got the fluff to stick his snout into things nevertheless and has a knack to move about unnoticed and ignored. He simply lacks presence and knows how to use it. </em></p>

<p><em>Cadet Ziggy might be Valnoses opposite, if you don&#39;t see her, you can most certainly hear her. If there&rsquo;s raucous laughter and merry going somewhere on the ship, you&rsquo;ll find her in the center of it all. Wild and brash, she has a swashbucklers way about her and have gotten into the good graces of the toughest lot on the ship. Even the Raptorians seem to enjoy her presence.</em></p>

<p><em>The three of them seem to get along, at least so far. Its still early and their days in the academy together to bind them. But im sure they are all aware that its rare for more then one out of three academy cadets in a batch to advance in ranks. Much less return home sometimes. Its an experience i myself almost learned the hard way on my first virgin voyage after the academy. But who&#39;s softness under who&#39;s belt now, eh? </em></p>
